# DSC180A Capstone Project - Beyond the Buzz

## Overview
This project aims to mitigate the gap of truth identification in a new world where bias and sensationalism are prevalent in the political landscape through the use of mutliple factuality factors.
We use the LIAR-PLUS dataset to train separate models for:

- Frequency Heuristics: detecting overuse of buzzwords and repetition.  
- Echo Chambers: measuring topic and party alignment.  
- Sensationalism: identifying exaggeration and emotional language.  
- Credibility: assessing the speaker's overall reliability.

Each model captures a unique dimension of factuality, contributing to a broader framework for automated fact-checking.
