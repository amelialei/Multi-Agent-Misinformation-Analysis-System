# DSC180A Capstone Project - Beyond the Buzz

## Overview
This project aims to mitigate the gap of truth identification in an era where bias and sensationalism are prevalent in the political landscape through the use of mutliple factuality factors.
We use the LIAR-PLUS dataset to train separate models for:

- Frequency Heuristics - detecting overuse of buzzwords and repetition.  
- Echo Chambers - measuring topic and party alignment.  
- Sensationalism: identifying exaggeration and emotional language.  
- Credibility - assessing the speaker's overall reliability.

Each model captures a unique dimension of factuality, contributing to a broader framework for automated fact-checking.

## Repository Structure
- src/ - Contains all source code for model building, configuration, and execution.  
- code.py - Core logic for each factuality model, including training and prediction functions.  
- script.py - The main entry point that loads the dataset, builds models, runs predictions, and outputs results.  
- config.json - Central configuration file specifying dataset paths and hyperparameters for each model.  

- data/ - Local folder containing the LIAR-PLUS dataset (`train2.tsv`, `val2.tsv`, `test2.tsv`).  
*(Note: this folder is excluded from GitHub via `.gitignore` for size and licensing reasons.)*  

- requirements.txt - Lists all Python dependencies needed to reproduce the environment.  

- .gitignore - Ensures unnecessary files (like `venv/`, cache directories, or data files) are not pushed to GitHub.
