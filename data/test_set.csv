State Sen. Sydney Batch, a Wake County Democrat who is the chamber’s minority leader, recently introduced abillto make North Carolina’s judicial elections nonpartisan. North Carolina’s judicial races are receiving extra attention this year because the November election for an open North Carolina Supreme Court seat remains uncertified. Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin is challenging the eligibility of 60,000 voters who cast ballots in his race against Democrat incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who received 734 more votes than Griffin, recounts showed. Batch discussed her bill during a Feb. 28 appearance on aWUNC-FM podcast. In it, she accused her Republican colleagues of politicizing the court. ""In North Carolina, and in its history, we always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it,"" Batch said. Republican legislators in recent years made formerly nonpartisan judicial races partisan by requiring that candidates’ party affiliations appear next to their names on ballots. But Batch’s description of the court’s longer history is inaccurate. North Carolina first started electing judges after the Civil War, said Michael Crowell, author of a judicial elections historyreportfor the University of North Carolina School of Government. ""It was seen as a one of many democratic reforms,"" Crowell said. ""And those were partisan elections. The idea of nonpartisan elections just didn't cross anybody's mind."" The voting process was different during Reconstruction than it is now, said Gerry Cohen, who wrote most of the state’s election laws during his 32-year tenure in the legislature's bill drafting office. Party operatives wouldprint ballotswith the names of candidates on them, he said. Voters could simply take a ballot from a party operative and place it in the ballot box to vote. ""Back before literacy, the Democratic Party had a symbol and the Republican Party had a symbol,"" Cohen said. North Carolina’s judicial elections were partisan throughout most of the 20th century, when Democrats controlled the state Legislature. However, when Republicans started winning more judicial races in the 1990s, Democrats moved to make the races nonpartisan,WRAL reported. ""Republicans started getting elected to some offices in the ’70s and ’80s, but it didn't trickle down to judges until the ’90s,"" Crowell told PolitiFact NC in an interview. Democrats didn’t publicly point to any judicial election losses as the reason for making the races nonpartisan, Crowell said. But it was understood to be a factor. ""No Democrats said in the mid ’90s, ‘Look, we need to change this, because Republicans are starting to win elections.’ But that was pretty much what was thought to be the case,"" Crowell said. Elections in different levels of the court system became partisan in different years. Superior court races went from partisan to nonpartisan in 1998. District court elections became nonpartisan in 2002. And the Supreme Court and other appellate court races went nonpartisan in 2004. Then, in 2011, Republicans gained control of the state Legislature for the first time in more than a century. Within a few years, they started making judicial races partisan again. Lawmakers added partisan labels to Court of Appeals candidates in 2016, and to Supreme, Superior and district courts in 2018. The change has paid off: Voters had largely split on judicial elections when they were nonpartisan, but after Republicans made the races partisan again, they’ve won almost every statewide judicial election. The GOP now controls large majorities on the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court. Batch’s office declined to comment for this fact check. Crowell offered a disclaimer to those interested in North Carolina's judicial elections history: ""Keep in mind: both parties have changed their position on fundamental issues over the years about the election of judges depending on what they think benefits them in the short run."" Batch said North Carolina ""always had nonpartisan judicial races and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it.""

Volokh gave us a close analogy with the case of Boerne vs.  Flores, a religious freedom law that glided through Congress but was held unconstitutional by a majority of the court, including two of its liberal justices.

He argued that invalidation of the health care law would represent a court action unseen since the Great Depression on an issue that affects every American. Ornstein echoed that interpretation, saying that a ruling by the court which overturns a major social policy and challenges prior court rulings would be unprecedented.

Va. students, who pay the added costs of room and board as well as other fees. estimates of the full cost for attending in the 2013-14 school year ranged from $26,000 to $31,000 for in-state students. That price doesnt include an additional $8,800 the state provided to pay for Virginia undergraduates education. Out-of-state students bottom-line cost can range from $54,000 to $60,000. When all those costs are put together, they exceed the annual prisoner costs Sanders cites. If their incarceration surpasses four years, then it easily could surpass the cost of sending a student to the University of Virginia. Also, if that prisoner is held in a state such as New York, with high state prisoner incarceration costs of roughly $60,000 annually, it also could outpace the cost of sending someone to U. Va."

1,barely-true,“North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the south.”,anderson clayton,Unknown,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,press release,"North Carolina Democrats are calling on state legislators to boost public school teacher pay. Arguing its case, the party said Oct. 29 that Tar Heel State teachers draw the South’s lowest salaries. ""North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the South and thanks to the NCGOP’s inability to pass a budget their take home pay continues to decrease while the cost of living and inflation only skyrocket,"" state party Chair Anderson Claytonsaidin a written statement. North Carolina’s legislature primarily funds public school districts, including teacher salaries. The state’s Republican-controlled House and Senate are at an impasse over funding after failing to agree on a long-term spending plan before the current fiscal year’s July 1 start. The state is operating on funding levels in the previous budget, approved in 2023. That means teachers won’t see significant salary increases, unless lawmakers reach an accord. The state Department of Public Instruction, which oversees the state’s public schools, collects data related to public school education and employee salaries. We emailed the department to ask about Clayton’s claim that North Carolina teachers are the ""lowest paid teachers in the South."" A DPI spokesperson told PolitiFact North Carolina that the department doesn’t track pay in other states, and therefore doesn’t know exactly how teacher salaries in North Carolina compare to teacher salaries in other states. The spokesperson instead referred us todata collected by the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union. NEA tracks the average teacher salary in each state, as well as the average salary for teachers who are starting their careers. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, North Carolina’s average teacher salary of $58,292 ranked 43rd in the nation. The state’s average starting salary of $42,542 ranked 39th in the nation. How does that compare to other Southern states? NEA data shows average teacher salaries are lower in Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana than in North Carolina. Starting salaries are lower in Mississippi and Kentucky. A PolitiFact review of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsdatafrom 2024 — the most recent year of complete data available — found average teacher pay to be lower in Mississippi than in North Carolina, as well. PolitiFact asked NEA if there’s any metric showing North Carolina with the lowest teacher pay in the South. Staci Maiers, the association’s spokeswoman, said NEA believes it’s more useful to compare a state to its neighbors than to an entire region. ""It would be more accurate to say that North Carolina teachers are the lowest paid among its neighboring states, behind Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and even South Carolina,"" Maiers said. The NEA numbers include base-level pay set by state lawmakers, as well as supplemental pay provided by local-level governments. Public Schools First NC, a nonprofit organization that researches public education issues, published areportearlier this year that compared teachers’ base pay, among Southern states. The analysis excluded supplemental pay. The group’s comparison, which doesn’t include teacher pay information for Florida or Virginia, found that North Carolina’s base pay for starting teachers to be the lowest of all the other Southern states. North Carolina’s new teachers make base pay of $41,000 annually. The next lowest is Mississippi’s $41,500. Supplemental pay provided in North Carolina’s richest counties could make overall starting salaries look larger than they are, said Public Schools First NC spokesperson Heather Koons. ""In North Carolina, Wake County has a nice, robust local supplement because we have a stronger tax base in Wake County, whereas others don’t,"" Koons said. In comparing each state’s base pay, Koons said: ""We wanted to compare apples to apples."" When we asked Clayton about the NEA data, she responded by email with sarcasm: ""After seeing the data, we’d like to formally apologize to the GOP leadership in the General Assembly for misspeaking and not recognizing that they made sure that North Carolina teachers are not in the bottom 15% for teacher pay but instead, only in the bottom 20."" Clayton said ""North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the South."" Data from the NEA, the largest teachers’ union in the nation, shows North Carolina’s teacher salaries are among the lowest among neighboring states, but not the lowest. Other southern states have lower average teacher salaries and lower starting teacher salaries than North Carolina. The NEA’s data includes both state-level base pay and supplemental pay provided by local governments. If supplemental pay is excluded, North Carolina’s base pay for starting teachers is, indeed, lower than other southern states, according to a North Carolina-based education nonprofit. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False."
