"A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he’s acting as a king.

But Donald Trump and his entourage responded with mockery to weekend “No Kings” protests by millions of Americans — embracing the narrative in a way that explains his growing hubris and belief that he has unchecked power.

The president and Vice President JD Vance this weekend both posted AI memes to social media depicting Trump in a crown. The one Trump shared was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance’s troll on Bluesky, a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler.

It was a clever political trick. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters’ gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.

Trump’s post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He’s far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don’t agree with. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump’s rise to power.

Moreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.

But the president’s social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren’t for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don’t again rule America. He’s implying there’s no room for those who don’t support him and showing he’s willing to force them into line.

Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a government shutdown the president appears to have no desire to end.

But as Trump’s behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more universities refusing to bend to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.

The president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday’s mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.

“When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Trump’s latest monarchical moves

Trump’s recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.

His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president’s latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This followed his demands that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were followed by indictments scant weeks later.

Santos on Sunday related to CNN’s Dana Bash how he’d been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,” Santos said, “I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos’ former GOP colleague from New York, said of Santos: “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”

Pardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump’s treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system’s reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)

The president’s authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.

► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.

► Trump’s promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration’s unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress’ authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I’m not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn’t do this by himself.”

► Trump last week detailed his decision to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela, prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump stoked speculation of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won’t be done nicely.”

Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump’s methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America’s global reputation. His administration’s refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.

The saga is unfolding as Hegseth’s Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration’s draconian new press regulations. The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration’s determination to deploy troops on American soil.

Protesters challenge the administration’s dismissal of demonstrations

Trump aides tried to diminish and defame the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party’s constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”

There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president’s vulgar social media posts mocked them.

“We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”

In time, Saturday’s protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump’s first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.

At the least, they show that while many of Trump’s supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don’t.

And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a warning by Obama on Marc Maron’s final podcast that it wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We’re not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.

Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.

Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”

“It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.

Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”

That’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.

In some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.",2,0,2,2,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/trump-no-kings-protests-vance-cia-analysis
"Trump is 'committed' to $2,000 tariff dividend payments, White House says

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump remains ""committed"" to sending each American a $2,000 dividend check to be distributed from tariff revenue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.

White House officials are exploring ways to execute the plan put forward by Trump in a social media post over the weekend, Leavitt added, but she did not provide details about specific options.

""The president made it clear he wants to make it happen,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. ""So his team of economic advisers are looking into it.""

The firm stance from the White House comes days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to cast doubt on Trump's proposal, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation.

A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal.

""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent added.

Some economists have questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds.

Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue.

""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.""

The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments.

If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X.

As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department.

By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue.

In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue.

The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",0,0,0,1,https://abc7.com/post/trump-is-committed-giving-americans-2000-tariff-checks-white-house/18149579/
"The longest US government shutdown in history ended on Wednesday after more than 42 days, following the House of Representative’s passage of a bill negotiated by Republicans and a splinter group of Democrat-aligned senators.

The compromise sets the stage for government operations to return to normal through January, while leaving unresolved the issue of expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare health plans, which most Democrats demanded be extended in any deal to reopen the government.

After it was unveiled over the weekend, the Senate approved the compromise on Monday, and the House followed suit two days later by a margin of 222 in favor and 209 against, with two not voting. Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday night, saying “we’re sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was … the Democrats tried to extort our country”.

Six Democrats broke with their party to vote for the bill: Adam Gray of California, Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine. Two Republicans, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida, voted against it.

“The Democrat shutdown is finally over thanks to House and Senate Republicans,” House Republican leadership said in a statement.

“There is absolutely no question now that Democrats are responsible for millions of American families going hungry, millions of travelers left stranded in airports, and our troops left wondering if they would receive their next paycheck.”

In remarks on the House floor shortly before the vote, the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, had pledged to continue to press for the subsidies’ extensions.

“This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” he said. “Either Republicans finally decide to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits this year, or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J Trump once and for all. That’s how this fight ends.”

The spending standoff was the biggest battle between congressional Democrats and Republicans since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. It resulted in unprecedented disruptions to government services, with the Trump administration ordering cuts to commercial air travel across the country, and the first-ever halt to the largest federal food aid program.

Reeling from their election defeats last year, Democrats had seized on an end-of-September expiration of government funding to make a stand on healthcare, a signature issue of the party over the past decade and a half. The Obamacare tax credits were created during Joe Biden’s presidency, and lowered premiums for plans bought under the law.

Democrats wanted them extended as part of any deal to continue government funding. The party made other demands as well, including curbs on Trump’s use of rescissions to slash money Congress had previously authorized and an undoing of cuts to Medicaid which Republicans had approved earlier in the year. But as the battle went on, it became clear that an extension of the subsidies was the main objective.

Republicans, who control both the House and the Senate, counter-offered with a bill to fund the government through the third week of November, without any spending cuts or major changes to policy. They passed the measure through the lower chamber with only a single Democrat in support, but the minority used the Senate’s filibuster to block its passage there.

The shutdown began on 1 October, resulting in about 700,000 federal workers being furloughed. Hundreds of thousands of others, from active-duty military to law enforcement to airport security screeners, remained on the job without pay.

Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director known for his hostility towards the federal workforce, seized on the funding lapse to order further layoffs of government employees. He also cut funding for infrastructure projects in states that voted for Kamala Harris last year.

Though Trump ordered military members be paid in a move that many experts called probably illegal, other federal workers missed paychecks. Food banks began reporting increased demand as the shutdown went on, with the need worsening after the White House halted payments under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, citing the government funding lapse.

Last week, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, ordered a cutback in flights at US airports, saying air traffic controllers were facing unprecedented strain after weeks of unpaid work. Widespread flight cancellations were reported in the days that followed.

In the Senate, most Democrats remained onboard with the party’s strategy for weeks. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, held 14 votes on the GOP funding measure, but only three members of the minority caucus ever broke ranks to support it.

In early November, Democrats swept off-year elections, winning gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey by significant margins, as well as voter approval for new congressional maps in California that will help the party’s candidates.

Democratic leaders said the wins vindicated their strategy in the funding fight, a statement Trump echoed, saying “the shutdown is a big factor” in the GOP’s poor performance. He began pressing Republican senators to scrap the filibuster, which would have negated the 60-vote threshold spending legislation needs to clear in the chamber, where the GOP holds 53 seats.

Meanwhile, a small group of moderate members of the Senate Democratic caucus had been negotiating a compromise to end the shutdown. It ended up funding the government through January and undoing the layoffs the Trump administration had ordered after the shutdown began.

But it included no additional funding for the Affordable Care Act tax credits – instead, Thune agreed to allow a vote on the issue by mid-December. There’s no telling if it will win the GOP support needed to pass, and Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has not said he will put any legislation up for a vote.

Despite howls of outrage from both House and Senate Democrats, the Senate passed it with 60 votes on Monday: eight from lawmakers in the Democratic caucus, and the rest from Republicans.

Yet the fight over the ACA subsidies is unlikely to be over. People enrolled in the plans received notices of premium increases in November because of the tax credits’ expiration. One study predicted they would rise by an average of 26%, potentially bringing them to levels unaffordable to many.

With government funding expiring again at the end of January, Democrats could use the opportunity to again demand the subsidies be extended.

“Dozens of House Republicans have been claiming over the last few weeks that they know that is something that needs to be addressed,” Jeffries said in a Tuesday interview with CNN.

“And now we’re going to have to see some action or whether it was just talk from these House Republicans because Democrats are going to continue to stay in the arena as it relates to dealing with the healthcare crisis that Republicans have visited on the American people.”",0,0,0,1,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote

A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting is playing out in state capitals, in courtrooms and on the ballot.

The efforts to redraw U.S. House districts for partisan advantage got jump-started when President Donald Trump called upon Republican-led Texas to reshape districts so that the GOP could win more seats in next year’s elections.

Since then, lawmakers in Democratic-led California and Republican-led Missouri have approved revised districts, and officials in more states are considering it. Utah’s Republican-led Legislature endorsed an altered congressional map Monday — though in response to a court order, not Trump’s demands.

U.S. House districts typically are redrawn once a decade, immediately after a census. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.

The stakes are high, because Democrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House, which would allow them to impede Trump’s agenda. The president’s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, a fate Trump is trying to avoid.

Texas judges hear legal challenge to new districts

Federal judges in Texas are considering a legal challenge to new congressional districts passed at Trump’s urging during a special legislative session in August. Civil rights groups and dozens of Black and Hispanic voters contend the new map intentionally reduces minority voters’ influence in violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. They want to prevent the new districts from being used.

Republicans hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats in Texas. The revised map could give Republicans a shot at picking up five additional seats in next year’s elections.

California voters are deciding on new House districts

Voting began Monday in California in advance of a Nov. 4 election that will determine whether new congressional districts are implemented.

Democrats already hold 43 of California’s 52 seats. But after Texas undertook redistricting, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged California lawmakers to reciprocate. They did so by passing a revised U.S. House map that could give Democrats a chance to gain five additional seats.

Unlike Texas, California has an independent citizens’ commission that handles redistricting after the census. So any changes to the map need voter approval.

Missouri redistricting faces potential referendum

After Texas and California took action, Missouri lawmakers joined the redistricting battle by passing a revised U.S. House map designed to give Republicans a shot at winning seven of the state’s eight districts — one more than they currently hold. The map targets a seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by stretching the Kansas City-based district into rural Republican areas and reducing the number of minority voters.

Opponents are pursuing a referendum petition that, if successful, would force a statewide vote on the new map. Opponents also have filed several lawsuits asserting that mid-decade redistricting isn’t allowed under the state constitution.

Utah lawmakers back new US House map

Utah’s Republican-led Legislature passed a revised U.S. House map Monday that could give Democrats an improved chance at competing for a seat. Republicans currently hold all four of the state’s seats.

The revised map would place Democratic-leaning Salt Lake City in a single district that stretches into rural areas, instead of splitting the city among multiple districts. But the revision still must be reviewed by a judge, who is expected to approve a new map by November.

A Utah judge in August struck down the House districts adopted after the 2020 census because the Republican-led Legislature circumvented an independent redistricting commission established by voters.

Kansas Republicans may call themselves into session

Republican lawmakers who hold a supermajority in the Kansas Legislature have been gathering petition signatures from colleagues in an attempt to call a special session on congressional redistricting in November. They are taking that route because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is unlikely to call a special session.

Republicans already hold three of the state’s four congressional districts. A revised map would target the suburban Kansas City district held by Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.

Indiana governor says redistricting session is probable

Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said that a legislative session on redistricting probably will happen, potentially as soon as November. Republican legislative leaders have met privately with Trump. But Braun has been waiting to call a special session until he is confident it will succeed.

Republicans hold a 7-2 edge over Democrats in Indiana’s congressional delegation. The GOP likely would target a northwest Indiana seat held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. They also could attempt to slice up an Indianapolis district held by a Democrat, but that could stir opposition by diluting minority voters’ influence.

Ohio must redraw its maps before the 2026 midterms

Ohio will have new U.S. House districts for the 2026 elections, though their shape remains to be determined. Republicans currently hold 10 of the state’s 15 congressional seats.

Ohio’s constitution requires new U.S. House districts because the ones adopted by Republican officials after the 2020 census didn’t have sufficient bipartisan support. If bipartisan consensus remains elusive, Republican lawmakers in November could adopt revised districts without need of any Democratic votes.

Maryland Democrats are proposing new districts

Some Democratic state lawmakers have said they will file redistricting legislation for the 2026 session, and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore also has expressed support.

“If we are going to have states in mid-cycle, in mid-decade, determining whether or not they have fair maps or not, then so will Maryland. Then, we should have that conversation, too,” Moore said last week.

Democrats control seven of the state’s eight U.S. House seats and could target an eastern Maryland district held by Republican Rep. Andy Harris.

Revised Louisiana districts hinge on a court case

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 15 in a legal challenge to Louisiana’s U.S. House districts, currently held by four white Republicans and two Black Democrats. A lawsuit contends state lawmakers wrongly used racial demographics when redrawing districts in response to a previous court ruling to give Black voters a better chance at electing the representative of their choice in two districts instead of one.

State lawmakers have been told to keep their calendars open between Oct. 23 and Nov. 13 in case the Supreme Court rules quickly and lawmakers could return for a special session on redistricting.

A trio of highly populated states have talked about redistricting

Officials Florida, Illinois and New York all have raised the possibility of redrawing U.S. House districts.

Republican Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez has created a special committee to look into redistricting. Republicans currently hold 20 of the state’s 28 seats.

Democrats already hold 14 of the 17 U.S. House seats in Illinois. But Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said it’s possible to redraw even more districts favoring Democrats.

New York has an independent commission that redraws districts after every census. State Democrats have introduced legislation to allow mid-decade redistricting, but the soonest new maps could be in place would be for the 2028 elections. That is because the proposal would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the Legislature twice and be approved by voters.",0,0,0,0,https://apnews.com/article/redistricting-gerrymandering-congress-trump-0af8561b1670032fae3e1d2aec7905f0
"Key Points Prop 50 passed in California, approving legislatively drawn congressional maps through 2030

Rural counties opposed the measure, revealing a sharp coastal-inland divide

Critics warn the new maps could reduce rural and Republican representation The passage of Proposition 50 has laid bare long-standing, and perhaps deepening, regional rifts in California’s political landscape according to academics and political scientists in the state. While Prop 50 passed with relative ease, the voting patterns underwriting its victory reveal a fractured political geography.

“There are large parts of the state’s geography that voted no on Proposition 50, and they are at risk of losing representation in Congress,” Mark Baldassare, survey director of the Public Policy Institute of California, told State Affairs. “Large parts of the state are going to feel like they don’t have representative democracy working for them because the voters in the more populous areas of the state have decided to make changes in the district boundaries.”

Proposition 50, approved by voters in a special election last week, temporarily suspends California’s independent redistricting commission and authorizes the use of new, legislatively drawn congressional district maps through the 2030 elections. The measure, proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature, was a response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. Its stated goal: to shift up to five congressional seats toward the Democrats.

Although political divides in California are often framed as urban-rural (code for Democrat-Republican) Baldassare argues that’s an oversimplification. The political terrain, he says, is more textured.

He suggests the state can be broadly divided into three regions: coastal, Central Valley and mountain constituencies. “The coastal vote, which is largely Democratic and represented by Democrats, is one category. Then the central vote, which is largely the Central Valley … and then there are the mountains, particularly the northeastern part of the state.”

It’s this northeastern corner that has emerged as California’s political outlier. Counties like Modoc, Shasta and Lassen posted some of the state’s highest “no” votes. Henry Brady, a professor of political science and public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, attributes that resistance to both geography and a persistent sense of exclusion.

“That part of the state has always felt cut off from the rest of California,” he said. “First of all, it’s 500 miles from any really nearby urban area. Second, it feels like the policies followed by the state are much more oriented toward the cities and the coast than toward the agricultural farmlands in places like Modoc.”

The region has long harbored secessionist ambitions. Since 2013, a fringe movement called the State of Jefferson, envisioning a breakaway state formed with parts of southern Oregon, has tapped into a feeling of political disconnect. “These are very small counties in terms of population, so they ultimately don’t have a big input in terms of political power,” Brady said. “And a lot of people in California know nothing about them, they’ve never been there.”

He added, “There’s been a long-standing, not, I don’t think, serious, but nevertheless extant, movement to separate themselves from California. So this would not be the kind of thing they would support.”

While the northeast is both geographically and politically remote, other voting patterns around Prop 50 defied easy classification. Most notably, southern counties like Riverside and San Bernardino, historically conservative inland counties, swung toward “yes.”

Brady attributes this to demographic shifts: a growing Hispanic population that trends more Democratic and was, in his words, “not happy with Mr. Trump.”

Even in the Central Valley, long seen as a conservative stronghold, results were mixed. “The voting between the two groups in counties like Fresno are much closer,” noted Blake Zante of the nonpartisan Maddy Institute based in the San JoaquinValley. “The current separation is about 100 votes between ‘yes’ and ‘no.’”

Deep pockets of Republican opposition remain throughout the Central Valley, particularly in Kern, Tulare and Kings counties. Brady describes these areas as dominated by “older white landowners.” Kern County, home to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is often dubbed “Texas in California” due to its oil and gas industries and staunch conservatism. “That’s a very, very conservative part of the state,” Brady said. “They’re Republicans.”

The implications of Prop 50 are significant for how the state’s citizens are represented — or not — by their elected officials. While Republicans make up 25% of California’s registered voters, they may soon hold as little as 10% of the state’s congressional seats.

“That’s particularly problematic for those one in four Californians who are Republicans,” Baldassare said. “It leads to feelings of political alienation and underrepresentation.”

Brady agreed, lamenting the decline of moderate Republican voices in the state. “It would be nice to have a strong Republican Party that once in a while gave us an Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example. We’ve had some darn good Republicans in California over the years.”

That sense of marginalization is already prompting political backlash. Just days after the vote, Assemblyman James Gallagher, who represents rural counties north of Sacramento, addressed the Shasta County Board of Supervisors. He called the passage of Prop 50 a “catalyst” to reintroduce a resolution to form a new state that would sever inland California from the coast.

While Gallagher’s proposal has little political traction, it underscores the deepening divide between a coast-dominated Legislature and a rural population that increasingly sees itself shut out.

Baldassare warned that Prop 50 may only intensify these divisions. “We have a state where, when you drive around, you realize that large geographic areas are in a different frame of mind politically than where most of the population lives, in coastal California.”

As the state gears up for the 2026 gubernatorial race, Proposition 50 has done more than redraw maps. It has again spotlighted deep demographic and geographic schisms.

“These are real divides in California,” said Baldassare. “The governor had talked about trying to bridge some of these political divisions — but this is not going in that direction.”

A review of the Prop 50 vote map shows that many of California’s most geographically expansive regions rejected the measure, and they now stand to lose congressional representation under the newly approved district lines.

“And therein lies the challenge for direct democracy in this case,” Baldassare said. “Coming up with something that works for the entire state. But large parts of the state are going to feel like they don’t have representative democracy working for them because the voters in the more populous areas have decided to make changes in the district boundaries. So it’s definitely a challenge.”",1,0,1,0,https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2025/11/12/prop-50-exposes-deepening-political-and-geographical-shifts-in-california/

After months of anticipation, the House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly passed a bill ordering the release of the Justice Department's files on late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

It passed 427-1 -- with GOP Rep. Clay Higgins as the only vote against the measure.

The bill will now head to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.

About a dozen Epstein victims, including Virginia Giuffre's brother, were seated in the front row of the gallery as the vote got underway. Some left the chamber after the tally grew above a supermajority and passage was not in peril.

Earlier on Tuesday, a group of women victimized by Epstein spoke outside the Capitol and urged lawmakers to vote yes on the bill. Several took aim at President Donald Trump directly and criticized his handling of the matter.

House Speaker Mike Johnson had tried to avoid holding a vote in the lower chamber on the Epstein matter. In late July, Johnson sent the House home a day early for August recess because the House was paralyzed in a stalemate over the Epstein issue.

The speaker also sent the House home for more than 50 days during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history -- delaying the swearing in of Democrat Adelita Grijalva. After the shutdown ended last week, the Arizona Democrat became the 218th signature on the Epstein discharge petition, compelling the speaker to bring a bill co-sponsored by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to the floor for a vote this week.

Johnson continued to criticize the bill on Tuesday morning but confirmed he would be voting to move it forward.

Just before votes were cast, Johnson said on the House floor that it was a ""political exercise"" and that the bill has ""serious deficiencies."" Johnson said he hoped the Senate makes changes to it.

""[Trump] has nothing to hide,"" Johnson said.

The president had also mounted opposition to the measure, including what sources said was an attempt to dissuade GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in the White House Situation Room from supporting the discharge petition to force a floor vote.

But faced with growing support for the measure in the GOP-controlled House, Trump suddenly reversed course over the weekend and said Republicans should vote yes on releasing the files ""because we have nothing to hide.""

Pressed if he will sign the bill should it reach his desk, Trump on Monday said he would.

""I'm all for it,"" Trump said.

The measure -- called ""The Epstein Files Transparency Act"" -- would compel Attorney General Pam Bondi to make available all ""unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials"" in the Department of Justice's possession related to Epstein.

The legislation seeks federal records on Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other individuals, including government officials, named or referenced in connection with Epstein's ""criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity, plea agreements or investigatory proceedings."" Victims' names and other identifying information would be excluded from disclosure, as would any items that may depict or contain child sex abuse material, according to the text of the proposed bill.

For months, Johnson has pointed at the House Oversight Committee's inquiry -- claiming that the panel's probe is more far-reaching than the Khanna-Massie bill. Proponents of the bill argue that ""the record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump's presidency.""

Trump does not need to wait for Congress to act -- he could order the release immediately.

Even if the measure passes through the House and Senate and is ultimately signed into law by Trump, it's unlikely the Justice Department would release the entire Epstein file, according to sources. Any materials related to ongoing investigations or White House claims of executive privilege will likely remain out of public view.

"More than 6 in 10 registered voters said they think “extreme political rhetoric” was an important contributor to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this year — including majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents, according to the latest NBC News poll.

The findings represent a grim milestone in America’s reckoning with growing political violence and its root causes. The survey marks the first time, across questions about five different violent incidents over 15 years of NBC News polling, that there has been cross-partisan agreement that rhetoric played an important role in an attack, as opposed to the incident having been more about the actions of a single disturbed person.

Overall, 61% of respondents said they feel that “extreme political rhetoric used by some in the media and by political leaders was an important contributor” to Kirk’s killing.

Another 28% said they “feel more this is an incident caused by a disturbed person.” And 4% of those who participated in the poll volunteered, when presented with those two options, that they thought it was some of both.

Republicans blamed rhetoric by the widest margin, 73%-19%, but independents (53%-28%) and Democrats (54%-34%) were also much more likely to blame extreme political rhetoric as a factor than to discount it.

Tyler Robinson, 22, faces murder and other charges in Utah for allegedly killing Kirk. Investigators discovered text messages Robinson sent after the shooting of Kirk in which Robinson wrote he “had enough of his hatred,” according to charging documents filed by the Utah County prosecutor.

President Donald Trump and his administration have blamed the left broadly for Kirk’s assassination.

“We have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years, and I believe is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin’s bullet,” Vice President JD Vance said while hosting Kirk’s eponymous show days after Kirk was killed.

On the same show, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller vowed to “use every resource we have” in the federal government to uproot a “vast domestic terror movement.”

The investigation has not uncovered evidence linking Robinson to left-wing groups, NBC News reported in September. Robinson’s mother told law enforcement that her son “had become more political and had started to lean more to the left” in the year preceding the shooting of Kirk.

NBC News has surveyed Americans’ feelings about several attacks on political figures in recent years: the shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., at an event in her district in 2011; the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., at a baseball practice in 2017; the hammer attack of Paul Pelosi, the husband of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at their home in 2022; and the attempted assassination of Trump at his Florida golf course in 2024.

The attempted assassination of Trump in September 2024 — the second attempt on his life in a matter of months, following the July shooting at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania — was the first time in NBC News polling that a majority of respondents overall pointed to rhetoric as an important factor in an episode of political violence.

In each incident, members of the victim’s political party have been more likely to pin blame on extreme rhetoric than on just one individual. But more respondents have blamed rhetoric from political and media figures each time.

The gap between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of extreme rhetoric as a factor was particularly wide in 2022, after the Pelosi attack, and in 2024, after the second attempt on Trump’s life.

In 2022, 74% of Democrats said extreme political rhetoric played a role in the Pelosi attack, for which the perpetrator was also convicted on charges of attempting to kidnap the then-speaker of the House. Forty-eight percent of independents and 25% of Republicans agreed.

In 2024, 76% of Republicans said rhetoric played a role in the attempted assassination of Trump, while 44% of independents and 39% of Democrats agreed.

The Kirk assassination was part of a troubling string of violent and deadly attacks against political figures and institutions this year. High-profile incidents include when an arsonist set fire to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence in April, former Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed in June, and a shooter fired on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas in September, killing immigrants in custody after allegedly trying to target agents.

"UK will not tolerate Chinese spying, minister says after MI5 alert

House of Commons

Security minister Dan Jarvis has said the government will not tolerate ""covert and calculated"" attempts to interfere with the UK's sovereign affairs, after MI5 warned MPs of the risk from Chinese spies. An alert issued to MPs, peers and parliamentary staff by security services identified two LinkedIn profiles, which it says are used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). It says they act as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit ""insider insights"". A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said accusations of espionage were ""pure fabrication"" and accused the UK of a ""self-staged charade"".

""We strongly condemn such despicable moves of the UK side and have lodged stern representations with them,"" the spokesperson said. They urged the UK to ""stop going further down the wrong path of undermining China-UK relations"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, circulated the MI5 warning to MPs and peers on Tuesday. The alert specifically identified two LinkedIn profiles set up with the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen. The BBC has contacted both for a response, although it is not clear if the women named and pictured on the networking site are the actual account holders. Simon Whelband, a researcher for Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, told the BBC he had been contacted by one of the accounts. After receiving the alert from Parliament, he searched his LinkedIn account and discovered a three-month-old message from a profile in the name of Shirly Shen. The message, written in poor English, included a potential job offer. Mr Whelband, who has reported the message to the parliamentary authorities, said he found the incident ""deeply worrying"". ""It's put me on edge a little bit, but I'm not surprised,"" he said, noting that O'Brien, the MP he works for, is a vocal critic of China. ""I've worked around Parliament for about 10 years now so I'm kind of used to this. ""But if you were more junior, you don't know what you're looking for. ""You might think it's a genuine offer that's made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept. ""If it was written in better English and looked more credible you could be fooled into thinking it was genuine.""

Simon Whelband Mr Whelband found the old message after searching in his LinkedIn account

In his letter to MPs, Sir Lindsay said both profiles were being used ""to conduct outreach at scale"" on behalf of the Chinese MSS. He said Chinese state actors were ""relentless"" in trying to ""interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament"". He said the Chinese MSS was ""actively reaching out to individuals in our community"", and that they wanted to ""collect information and lay the groundwork for long-term relationships, using professional networking sites, recruitment agents and consultants acting on their behalf"". Other elements of espionage described in the MI5 alert include all-expenses paid trips to China, and payment for information through cash or cryptocurrency. Targets are said to include ""Parliament staff, economists, think tank employees, geo-political consultants and those working alongside [the government] including MPs and members of the House of Lords"".

Jarvis announced a package of measures in the House of Commons to tackle espionage threats to the UK. These included £170m to upgrade encrypted technology for government business, as well as new protections against Chinese cybercrime and attempts to influence UK university research. Jarvis told MPs: ""Our intelligence agencies have warned that China is attempting to recruit and cultivate individuals with access to sensitive information about Parliament and the UK government."" He added: ""This activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it."" He warned China had a ""low threshold"" for what information is useful, as it attempts to build a wider picture. Jarvis highlighted a pattern of behaviour around Chinese spying attempts, which he said he would take ""all necessary measures"" to protect against, including updating and strengthening national security powers. He said rules will be tightened to tackle covert funding of political parties, while the Electoral Commission will be given greater enforcement powers. There will also be security briefings for all parties and candidates standing in the elections next May for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd, and councils across England. Stressing that China is still the UK's third biggest trading partner, Jarvis said the UK would nevertheless use sanctions ""as necessary"".

Conservative shadow Home Office minister Alicia Kearns urged the government to increase transparency of China's activities in the UK by putting the country on the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). Currently only Iran and Russia are in the enhanced tier, meaning someone cannot carry out work for the countries until they have registered their activity with the government. Kearns also said the government should cancel planned visits to China and reject an application to build a Chinese embassy at a sensitive location in central London. Jarvis said the government was ""looking closely at whether it is necessary to make further additions onto the enhanced tier"" for FIRS but added that ""no decision has yet been made"". On the embassy, he said the decision would be made by the housing secretary. Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the alert showed China was taking an ""aggressive position"" that ""blows a hole through all of that ridiculous nonsense"" about whether or not China was a threat to UK national security. ""We have to be much, much more vigilant,"" he told BBC News. ""Why is the government so unable to call China what it is, which is a persistent, continuing threat to Britain's national security. ""That is clear to every single member of the public… but somehow the government seems to think it isn't that clear.""",1,0,0,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpnz05kr8o
"Most Californians probably see the Capitol as a place where governors, legislators and other state officials gather to do the public’s business. That’s true, at least superficially.

Elected officeholders come and go, but the Capitol has a permanent substructure of men and women who do the real, if often hidden, business of retail politics. Those in the “community,” as some dub it, constantly circulate among its three pillars — staff on the public payroll, lobbyists for interest groups, and managers of political campaigns.

It’s not uncommon for someone to have portfolios in all three. And as the revolving door opens and closes, it’s difficult to discern when and where one role ends and another begins, or even whether there is, in fact, a difference.

Dana Williamson typifies the species. And her arrest last week on federal criminal charges opens a window into the secretive world of California’s professional political operatives.

The 23-count indictment alleges Williamson — who had been Gov. Gavin Newsom’s chief of staff until her abrupt resignation a year ago — conspired with two other figures to siphon money from a dormant political campaign fund maintained by Xavier Becerra, a former congressman, state attorney general and Biden administration cabinet member.

Williamson is also charged with falsifying documents to justify a COVID-era federal business loan, lying to FBI agents and falsely claiming income tax deductions as business expenses — for a lavish vacation and purchases of expensive designer goods.

The two men who were charged with Williamson, Sean McCluskie, Becerra’s former chief deputy in the California Department of Justice, and lobbyist Greg Campbell, have pleaded guilty. But Williamson insists that she is innocent.

It’s the juiciest scandal to hit the Capitol since the FBI’s undercover bribery investigation, dubbed “Shrimpgate,” erupted 37 years ago and sent some legislators and lobbyists to prison.

Among the Capitol’s power players, Williamson has stood near the top, working for three governors, lobbying for various interest groups and running ballot measure campaigns. She is known for a profanity-laced, take-no-prisoners style.

After Williamson was arrested, the question for many Capitol denizens was whether the case would adversely affect Becerra, who is running for governor, and Newsom, who is obviously, if not officially, running for president.

Becerra is a victim but may face questions about his judgment, since he was apparently being fleeced by those he hired.

Newsom’s office says Williamson resigned a year ago after telling him she was under investigation. At the time, he praised her as a dedicated public servant.

If there is something in the case that could harm Newsom, or at least give political rivals some ammunition, it is what happened shortly after Williamson became the governor’s top aide in 2023. According to the indictment, she used the position to intercede in a pending state discrimination suit against one of her lobbying clients, Activision Blizzard, a Santa Monica video game company, and then lied to FBI agents about the case.

In 2022 Janette Wipper, chief counsel of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which brought the case against Activision, was fired. Her assistant, Melanie Proctor, resigned in protest, citing pressure from the governor’s office to settle the case.

Proctor wrote in a public memo that the governor’s office “repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and next steps in the litigation” in the case, and the interference “mimicked the interests of Activision’s counsel.”

The Williamson scandal could be a one-and-done incident if her attorney negotiates a plea agreement. Or it could drag out if she insists on a trial and the dirty linen is displayed for all to see, perhaps revealing even more politically embarrassing episodes of backroom maneuvers.",0,0,1,1,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/dana-williamsons-indictment-political-operatives/
"A new KFF/New York Times Survey of Immigrants reveals deepening anxiety and fear among immigrants of all statuses amid the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement and restrictive policies. The survey paints a portrait of families under strain—where fear of detention and economic instability are negatively impacting immigrants’ health and reshaping immigrant families’ daily lives and views of U.S. political parties.

The partnership survey builds on KFF’s groundbreaking work surveying immigrants over the past few years, including a 2023 survey in partnership with the Los Angeles Times, a 2024 survey during the presidential election cycle, and a survey earlier this year that was paired with a focus group report on the experiences of undocumented immigrant families. As of June 2025, there were 51.9 million immigrants living in the U.S.

Findings from the new survey are detailed in three KFF reports and help inform the reporting in a package of news stories released by the New York Times. One KFF report focuses on the worries and experiences of immigrants amid increased immigration enforcement, a second examines the political views of immigrant voters, and a third probes the health and health care experiences of immigrants.

The survey finds that more than one in five (22%) immigrants personally know someone arrested, detained, or deported for immigration-related reasons since the president’s return to office—nearly triple the share from April 2025. Forty-one percent of immigrants now fear they or a family member could be detained or deported, up sharply from 26% in 2023. Fear has increased the most among lawfully present immigrants and naturalized citizens, indicating that growing unease is not confined to those who are undocumented.

About half of immigrants – across all statuses – report feeling less safe since the president’s second term began. Three in ten immigrants say they or a family member avoid traveling, working, going to other public spaces, or seeking medical care because of fear of enforcement since January. Among likely undocumented immigrants, this avoidance rises to three in four. More than half of immigrants (53%) lack confidence they would be treated fairly if detained.

About one in ten eligible U.S. voters today are naturalized citizens. In the current climate, nearly six in ten immigrant voters say their views on the Trump administration’s immigration policies have had an impact on which political party they support — including over four in ten who say they have had a “major impact.”

When immigrant voters are asked to describe how the administration’s immigration policies have impacted which party they support, a larger share express views that reflect negative views of these policies or a shift away from Republicans (36%) than express views in support of these policies or the Republican party (19%).

Among other key findings:

Most immigrants still say their own lives are better for coming to the U.S., and most would come again. But while about one-third say the U.S. is a great place for immigrants, nearly twice as many (60%) say the country used to be a great place for immigrants, but that’s no longer true.

About half of immigrants report struggling to pay for housing, food, or health care—up from 31% in 2023. Many say it’s become harder to earn a living since January.

Four in ten (40%) immigrant adults overall and nearly eight in ten (77%) likely undocumented immigrants say they have experienced negative health impacts since January 2025 due to immigration-related worries. These include increased stress, anxiety, or sadness; problems sleeping or eating; and/or worsening health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. About one in five (18%) immigrant parents say that their child’s well-being has been impacted due to immigration-related worries since January 2025.

The share of immigrant adults who reported skipping or postponing health care in the past 12 months increased from 22% to 29% between 2023 and 2025. Among those who went without care, about one in five (19%) say it was due to immigration-related concerns. About three in ten (30%) immigrant parents say that any of their children delayed or skipped health care in the past 12 months due to immigration-related fears, cost or lack of insurance, and/or not being able to find services at a convenient time or location, rising to about six in ten (58%) of parents who are likely undocumented.

The KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants is a probability-based, nationally representative survey of 1,805 immigrant adults (U.S. adults born outside the U.S) conducted between August 28 – October 20, 2025. Respondents were contacted online, by mail, and by telephone, and had the choice to complete the survey in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Haitian Creole.

"This reckoning comes at a critical time.

We are halfway through what strategists in both U.S. political parties believe will be a decisive decade that determines whether America can avoid falling behind China economically, technologically and militarily. Mr. Trump’s team is moving urgently to bring manufacturing back to the United States, rebalance trade and rebuild the defense industrial base.

The outcome of the recent summit could undercut those important efforts.

Mr. Trump framed the meeting as a U.S.-China “G2,” diminishing the importance of allies whose help America needs to reindustrialize at home and balance China abroad. And by showing Beijing that its coercive tools work, Mr. Trump risks inviting more pressure, potentially giving China veto power over his “America First” agenda.

None of this had to happen. The road to Busan began with needless provocation by Mr. Trump. In February, he reignited the trade war that he started in his first term, levying tariffs on Chinese goods that eventually rose past 140 percent. But he failed to first assess America’s own vulnerabilities or shore up its supply chains. By contrast, Beijing had spent the years since 2018, when Mr. Trump first began imposing tariffs, preparing for exactly this moment.

Backed into a corner, Mr. Xi reached for his break-glass tool. In April, he halted exports to the United States of rare earths minerals and magnets — critical materials for everything from cars to missiles — an escalation beyond anything he had threatened under President Joe Biden. It was a calculated risk given the potential for more American retaliation. But Mr. Xi gambled that Mr. Trump would fold. He was right. In May, Mr. Trump radically reduced tariffs and pursued de-escalation.

Emboldened, China wielded rare earths again in October — and raised the stakes dramatically. Using the pretext of new U.S. export controls, Beijing responded with a sweeping licensing regime requiring companies anywhere in the world to obtain China’s approval not only to buy the country’s rare earths but to sell any product made with even trace amounts of them.",0,0,1,2,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/trump-china-xi-trade.html
"Elon Musk, the world’s most successful businessman and President Donald Trump’s top White House adviser, said this week that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered shocking cases of fraud within the federal government.

Musk made the remarks during a Monday meeting with the president and his cabinet secretaries.

“One case of fraud was with the Small Business Administration, where they were handing out loans—$330 million worth of loans—to people under the age of 11,” Musk said. “I think the youngest, Kelly, was a 9-month-old who got a $100,000 loan.”

“That’s a very precocious baby we’re talking about here,” Musk quipped.

SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler followed up Musk’s remarks by saying, “We’re tackling the fraud, waste, and abuse at the agency.”

“We’ve seen, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud go unprosecuted, so we’re taking that on,” she said. “We have a zero-tolerance policy for fraud, and we continue to crack down on it and make sure people are held accountable.”

Trump said that they have found “far too much” fraud, waste, and abuse in the government over the last couple of months.

“It’s pure fraud,” he said. “We like to use the words ‘waste’ and ‘abuse’ because they sort of sound good, but many of these things are pure fraud.”

Remarks to the Security Council on the Sudan

New York, 30 October 2025

Mr. President

Since my last briefing to this Council, the conflict in Sudan has deteriorated even further. It has caused widespread suffering and new surges of horrific violence.

After more than 500 days under siege, the city of El Fasher in North Darfur has been captured by the Rapid Support Forces. Only small pockets of resistance remain.

The fall of the city marks a significant shift in the security dynamics. The implications for the people of Sudan and the region are significant.

Other parts of the country have not been spared from the relentless violence.

In recent weeks, fighting has intensified in the Kordofan region. This is likely the next arena of military focus for the warring parties.

In North Kordofan, the city of Bara, just 40 kilometers from the state capital of El Obeid and a strategic location for both sides, was captured by the Rapid Support Forces last week. This marked another escalation on the ground.

Drone strikes by both parties are also affecting new territories and new targets. These include Blue Nile, Khartoum, Sennar, South Kordofan and West Darfur, suggesting that the territorial scope of the conflict is broadening.

Following the announcement of its reopening, the airport in Khartoum quickly became the target of a barrage of drone attacks. This showed that control of the city remains contested, and that no part of Sudan is beyond reach.

The implications of these drone strikes are clear – mounting civilian casualties, increased humanitarian and protection needs, and the continued erosion of essential infrastructure and livelihoods.

Mr. President,

Shifting military dynamics continue to shape the course of the conflict. The human cost is profound.

The risk of mass atrocities, ethnically targeted violence and further violations of international humanitarian law, including sexual violence, remains alarmingly high across the country, and particularly in El Fasher.

The situation is simply horrifying. In the past week, the UN Human Rights Office has documented widespread and serious human rights violations in and around El Fasher. These include credible reports of mass killings in various locations and summary executions during house-to-house searches and as civilians have tried to flee the city.

Communications have been cut off. The situation is chaotic. In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed.

Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in El Fasher. There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.

There are also reports of large-scale atrocities perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces in Bara, in North Kordofan, following the recent capture of the city. These included reprisals against so-called “collaborators”, which are often ethnically motivated.

At least 50 civilians have been killed over the past few days in Bara, both during fighting and as a result of summary executions. This allegedly includes the summary execution of five Red Crescent volunteers.

The United Nations will continue to call for all those with influence to act now to prevent further violations and atrocities.

Efforts towards accountability will also continue to be essential to end the cycles of violence. The recent renewal of the UN Fact-Finding Mission’s mandate, and the ICC verdict in the case of Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman signal the international community’s continued commitment to justice and accountability in Sudan.

Mr. President

This week the Secretary-General once again renewed his call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.

It is high time to take the first step towards lasting peace for the Sudanese people.

The parties must return to the negotiating table, in good faith. They must pursue a sustainable resolution to the conflict.

An immediate end to the fighting and sustained dialogue are needed to reverse Sudan’s spiraling descent into de facto fragmentation.

The Secretary-General has also been unequivocal in his call for external interference in Sudan’s conflict to stop.

External support is enabling the conflict. Weapons and fighters continue to flow into Sudan, further contributing to the already desperate situation.

Mr. President,

Given the deteriorating situation on the ground, Personal Envoy Lamamra has invited both parties to separately enter into technical talks with the United Nations, focused on de-escalation and the protection of civilians.

He has received encouraging indications from both parties of their willingness to commit to this process.

We urge Member States with leverage over the parties to encourage them to take this critical step which could lead to an improvement in the protection of civilians throughout Sudan.

Mr. President,

Coordination among Sudan’s international partners is essential to maximize our collective efforts to end this war. In this regard, Personal Envoy Lamamra has intensified his engagements with regional and international actors.

The Quartet mechanism - comprising the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the League of Arab States and the United Nations - is preparing an inter-Sudanese dialogue, under the auspices of the African Union, which could pave the way for a Sudanese-owned and led political process.

Consultations are ongoing with key Sudanese stakeholders to refine the design, timeline and criteria for participation, and map out the role of the sponsoring organisations.

Personal Envoy Lamamra is also coordinating his efforts with members of the Quad initiative - comprising Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.

Mediation efforts by regional and international actors are welcome and essential. To be effective and deliver solid outcomes, they must be underpinned by strong coordination, ensuring complementarity and coherence with other efforts.

In that regard, Personal Envoy Lamamra is currently finalizing consultations with the African Union on the next Consultative Group meeting, to be jointly convened at Ministerial level by the African Union and the United Nations in Addis Ababa.

This meeting will provide an opportunity for all mediation actors to exchange information, take stock of efforts and map out areas of complementarity and comparative advantage as they consider next steps.

Mr. President,

As the conflict reaches yet another critical point, we must intensify our call for an urgent and lasting solution.

Reports and warnings about the unfolding catastrophe in El Fasher have been issued for months. Thus far, the Unted Nations Security Council has not taken decisive action to prevent the situation from deteriorating.

We must all play our part in helping to bring this devastating war to an end. We must stand with the people of Sudan who have suffered far too much for far too long.

I call on the Council to use all the tools at its disposal to demand peace in the Sudan. We count on the Council to lead the way.",1,0,1,1,https://dppa.un.org/en/mtg-sc-10027-asg-pobee-30-oct-2025
"Washington — More than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood alongside Democratic and GOP lawmakers and pressed Congress to look beyond politics, with the House set to vote Tuesday on a bill to release the government's remaining files related to the investigation of his crimes.

""This is one of the most horrific and disgusting corruption scandals in our country's history,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill. ""Because survivors spoke up, because of their courage, the truth is finally going to come out.""

At a news conference outside the Capitol, the accusers called for transparency and argued that releasing the files should transcend politics.

Haley Robson said, ""It's time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side."" ""This is not an issue of a few corrupt Democrats or a few corrupt Republicans, this is a case of institutional betrayal,"" said Annie Farmer. And Liz Stein said ""the Epstein files are not about loyalty to any one political party. They're evidence of a crime.""

""In a divided nation, this is one demand we all share,"" said Lisa Phillips.

The House vote, which is expected Tuesday afternoon, comes after four Republicans joined all Democrats to sign a petition to force a vote on the issue, circumventing House GOP leadership. Although President Trump initially expressed opposition to the release of the files and lashed out against Republicans who advocated for the release of the files, he changed his tune Sunday when it was evident the bill would pass. He urged House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files ""because we have nothing to hide.""

Another Epstein accuser, Jena-Lisa Jones, spoke of the emotionally ""distressing"" back-and-forth from the administration regarding the release of the files. She called on the president, whom she said she voted for, to ""show some real leadership,"" adding that his ""behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.""

""I beg you, President Trump, please stop making this political,"" Jones said. ""It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it.""

Interest in the files has grown since July, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no ""client list"" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Since then, there's been widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.

Khanna outlined the widespread nature of the allegations from Epstein's accusers, saying, ""There should be no buildings named after people in this Epstein class, there should be no scholarships named after them, they shouldn't be enjoying the perks of being affiliated with corporations or universities or writing op-eds or being lionized."" He added that ""many of the survivors will tell you, some of these people still are celebrated in our society.""

The California Democrat said the accusers ""are the ones who made today possible,"" adding that for decades, ""we have not done enough about this issue.""

Khanna also praised Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, whom he said have suffered ""extraordinary political consequences"" for their work on the issue.

Massie thanked the women, saying they're ""giving everybody hope in this country.""

""There are survivors of other sex crimes in this country wondering if they should come forward,"" Massie said. ""These survivors have stepped forth, taking that same risk, worried that they will be defamed themselves — they have been defamed for stepping forward — but we're going to get justice for them. That's going to happen today in the People's House.""

Greene praised the women for coming forward, saying, ""These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight."" She said they did so by fighting together ""against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today.""

The Georgia Republican noted she's been ""called a traitor"" by Mr. Trump in recent days in a public spat that seems to stem from the Epstein files.

""I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America first — and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,"" she said.

""Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries, and themselves."" Greene said.

""Today you are going to see probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files,"" Greene said. ""But the real fight will happen after that.""

The ""real test"" will be whether the DOJ will release the files, or whether they will remain ""tied up in investigations,"" Greene said. She and Massie have raised the possibility that if the Justice Department opens investigations into Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, as Mr. Trump has suggested, they could be used to block the files' release.

Massie said while ""they can try to protect a few certain people or a few certain companies, those investigations will eventually end."" He added, ""They can't open enough investigations to cover up everything that's in these files.""

But if the bill passes in the House, it would next head to the Senate for approval, where Republican leaders have not said whether they'll bring it up for a vote. Massie appealed to the upper chamber in his remarks, asking the Senate not to derail the effort.

""If you do anything that prevents any disclosure, you are not for the people and you are not part of this effort,"" Massie said. ""Do not muck it up in the Senate.""",0,0,0,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epstein-accusers-lawmakers-vote-epstein-files/
"Former New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira - who is running for congress in Texas and is seeking the Republican Party's endorsement - is defending immigration officers.

Teixeira, who won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009, says that agitators are purposely creating threats to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

The Department of Homeland Security posted a message to social media saying 'anti-ICE radicals' are attempting to 'demonize American law enforcement'.

Specifically, the government is saying that videos created with artificial intelligence (AI) are being shared on the internet.

'The REALITY: these disgusting smears and lies are fueling the 1000% increase in assaults and nearly 8000% increase in death threats against our brave @ICEgov officers,' the agency said.

'The SICKOS spreading this filth must stop before they get someone killed.'

Former New York Yankees star Mark Teixeira says ICE officers need to be protected

The acting director of ICE warned that if agents go unmasked, AI could be used against them

Teixeira quote-tweeted that post on his X account and wrote, 'We have to stand up for ICE officers and law enforcement against these dangerous threats.'

Unlike traditional law enforcement, ICE agents have largely been able to conduct their operations without giving out their name or a badge number - with some donning masks over their face.

Speaking to Fox News in July, acting ICE director Todd Lyons said that if agents were forced to go maskless and identify themselves, the use of AI could lead to safety concerns.

'If legislation passes to try to unmask ICE agents, they are not allowed to wear them, it runs the risk of agitators, different groups, you know, these fringe organizations using reverse technology, AI, to try to dox their families, try to get their identity, their home addresses,' Lyons said.

'We've heard elected officials say there shouldn't be any rest for ICE agents or their families. So, they're definitely concerned about that.

'They're also concerned about their own well-being when they go out to effectuate these arrests because now we have to send more officers out into the communities because where we can send four or five to make arrests in the past, now we had to send up to eight or 10 just to protect the four that are making the arrests of one individual.'

"Republicans appear determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act, but what will go in its place? It’s a question the party has struggled to answer since the ACA passed. Remember Trump’s first term promise to “repeal and replace” Obamacare that never came to fruition?

Since the government shut down a month ago, the party has refused to publicly discuss a plan, even as ACA subsidies expire at the end of the year, forcing Americans to pay astronomically higher monthly premiums. In New Jersey, some premiums will rise by more than 175 percent. One family’s premiums will spike 300 percent. Across the board, premiums are expected to increase by an average of 26 percent for a typical ACA plan, a recent KFF analysis revealed.

The Republicans’ so-called health care plans are so secret, in fact, they won’t share them with members of their own party. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called out House Speaker Mike Johnson last week for not disclosing the party’s plans during a GOP conference call, said during an appearance on Friday’s Real Time with Bill Maher: “Mike Johnson, for a month now, cannot give me a single policy idea.”

She said at another point during the show, “I’m waiting for the [healthcare] plan. I haven’t seen it yet.”

(In true MTG style, she also admitted to believing that aliens are space demons, saying, “That’s what makes sense in my worldview.”)

Confronted with Greene’s criticism on Fox News Sunday, Johnson said, “I don’t know what to say about that. That’s absurd. Obviously, we’re not gonna be on a conference call explaining all of our plans and strategies for healthcare reform because they’re leaked in real time, literally… They’re supposed to be private, but they’re not.”

Johnson then claimed that Greene can visit his office “any day at any hour” and he will “lay out everything for her.” He then referenced a 2019 Republican Study Committee plan that proposed changes to healthcare, including re-establishing high-risk pools. Editor’s picks

Sen. John Kennedy floated the idea of high-risk pools in an interview on CNN last week.

“There are a number of ideas being batted around association health plans,” the Republican senator from Louisiana said, adding, “bringing back high risk pools, which have been outlawed under the Affordable Care Act.”

John Kennedy on Republican healthcare ideas: ""Bringing back high risk pools, which have been outlawed under the ACA."" — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) 2025-10-29T20:32:54.952Z

These types of pools existed before the ACA banned them, and they were plagued with issues. Premiums in these pools were often twice the rate that lower risk people paid, they often excluded coverage for pre-existing conditions for the first 6-12 months, many had a lifetime coverage limit, and numerous states restricted how many people could join their pool, according to KFF.

Bringing back high-risk pools will only bring back the problems they caused.

Perhaps GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew best summarized the state of the party’s plans: “It is politically stupid. It does not make sense to come up with no plan dealing with health care… The plan is to come up with something better.”

So the plan is to have a plan — eventually. But, Van Drew warned, don’t expect to see that plan anytime soon.

“That’s going to take a good part of the year, to have something substantive and real that works,” he said.

In the meantime, without a resolution to the shutdown that includes a continuation of the ACA subsidies, millions of Americans will suffer from astronomically higher premiums. All because the Republicans are set on destroying Obamacare, alongside other Democratic policy initiatives. Meanwhile, they continue to enjoy their cushy government health benefits.

"Gavin Newsom is everywhere. Here’s the California governor traveling the length of his state campaigning for Proposition 50, a redistricting measure that could give Democrats five more House seats. Here’s Newsom in Houston, four days after winning big on Prop 50, speaking to a hall packed with cheering union workers. Then Newsom is off to Brazil, appearing at the United Nations Climate Conference and seizing the spotlight abdicated by President Donald Trump.

That ubiquity, in real life and online, is a big reason Newsom is somewhere else too: atop lists to win the next Democratic presidential nomination. All he needs to do is maintain this momentum for nearly three more years—an eternity in modern political life.

Newsom hasn’t officially declared he’s running, saying recently that he’ll give “serious thought” to the idea after next year’s midterms. But his camp has a plan for how to get from here to an acceptance speech at the 2028 Democratic National Convention. “Gavin’s infrastructure is a highly developed, ready-for-president infrastructure,” a Newsom insider says. “It was that last year”—when Joe Biden finally stepped aside, and there was briefly talk of an open Democratic primary—“and it is even more so now.”

The first phase of the groundwork is well underway. Newsom has positioned himself as aggressively, creatively anti-Trump, from standing up to last summer’s National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to relentlessly trolling the president on X. The release of thousands of emails related to Jeffrey Epstein has given Newsom another, if dicey, opening to mock the president, with the governor’s press office posting a cartoon of Epstein and Trump grinning between palm trees above a caption reading “Island Boys.” “Newsom has figured out how to win the attention primary, which is what this is all about now,” the insider says.

More tangibly, the Prop 50 campaign—in which Newsom raised nearly $40 million in small-dollar contributions—enabled him to expand his already prolific digital-fundraising operation. Newsom’s cash machine will be central to the next step: backing candidates to restore Democratic control of the House in the 2026 midterms. “He has the ability to help next year in a way that few other people in politics do,” another Newsom ally says. “If we win the House back next year, he’s going to be the guy who did that.” And even if the governor’s PAC, the Campaign for Democracy, doesn’t help swing enough races next November, Newsom’s active involvement around the country could build a highly useful favor bank should he mount a 2028 primary campaign.",1,0,1,1,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/gavin-newsom-presidential-campaign-2028

"California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday.

The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly, even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of the commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.

""After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,"" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. ""This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.""

RELATED STORY | Transportation Department imposes new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses for noncitizens

Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.

At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.

Still, Newsom's spokesperson, Brandon Richards, shot back at Duffy in a statement.

""Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,"" Richards said.

Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.

Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.

Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.

RELATED STORY | The trucking rule California won’t enforce — and why it’s now paying the price

The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers, while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.

Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after.

Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",1,0,1,1,https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/immigration/california-revokes-17-000-commercial-drivers-licenses-for-immigrants

This article is co-published with WFAA and ProPublica as part of an initiative to report on how power is wielded in Texas.

The year before President Donald Trump announced he was sending National Guard troops and federal agents into major cities like Washington, D.C., and Chicago, declaring crime out of control, a Dallas nonprofit made a similar case for putting more police on the streets.

“Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump said at an Aug. 11 press conference, announcing the unprecedented federal takeover of the Washington police force and the deployment of the National Guard to the city.

A year earlier, a man named Pete Marocco told Dallas City Council members that Dallas was descending into comparable anarchy.

“We cannot wait until Dallas looks like other degenerate cities that have made irreversible mistakes, devaluing their police force and destroying their city center,” said Marocco, who would go on to briefly lead the U.S. Agency for International Development under Trump.

At that time, Marocco was speaking as the executive director of a nonprofit called Dallas HERO, whose leaders wanted voters to pass propositions that would radically overhaul the city’s charter. One of them, a ballot measure known as Proposition U, would force Dallas to grow its police force to 4,000 officers, and significantly raise their starting pay, in order to address the kind of lawlessness Marocco claimed the city was experiencing.

Voters went on to narrowly pass the proposition in the same November election that put Trump back in the Oval Office. They also approved another “citizen enforcement” measure Dallas HERO got onto the ballot, Proposition S, which gave residents the right to more easily sue the city to block policies and have them declared unlawful by stripping Dallas of its immunity from litigation. The measure makes Dallas the first city in the country to lose its governmental immunity, legal experts said.

Few people in Dallas dispute that more police are needed; 911 call response times have increased in recent years, and growing the department’s size has been a goal of mayors, City Council members and police chiefs for decades. But violent crime here, as elsewhere nationally, is trending downward despite the growing claims by Trump and other leaders that certain cities are incapable of governing or policing themselves.

“We’re seeing the national government going into Washington and making noises about going into other cities — we’re talking about blue cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, Oakland, maybe New York,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who studies outside influences on city governments.

But what happened in Dallas last fall, he said, follows a different pattern from these federal or state government takeovers.

“It’s coming up from within the city,” he said. “The state isn’t imposing this; local voters have.”

Now, almost a year after voters approved these measures in Dallas, WFAA set out to understand how the Dallas HERO measures came to pass, look into the often misleading statements about violent crime that the group made to voters and explore the long-term effects of these changes.

Already, the city is feeling the effects of the two Dallas HERO-backed propositions voters passed on that November ballot.

In June, the Dallas City Council voted to change its police-hiring standards, eliminating its college credit requirement in an effort to hire more officers. Critics say lowering standards to boost hiring can lead to less-qualified officers patrolling the streets.

In September, the City Council approved a new budget for next fiscal year. It includes cuts to popular libraries and city pools and eliminates some city jobs, but adds money for 350 new police officers — still far short of the nearly 800 needed to reach the 4,000-officer minimum mandated by Proposition U, which had no timeline for compliance.

And earlier this year, a Dallas couple became the first known litigants against the city to cite Proposition S, the measure that eliminated the city’s governmental immunity, in a lawsuit over construction of a church game court. The couple initiated the lawsuit before Proposition S was passed but filed motions citing the city’s lack of immunity in March. The city of Dallas said in court that the proposition is unconstitutional but declined to comment about the lawsuit. The lawsuit, which is still pending, has not been previously reported.

All of this has locals, including local law enforcement, concerned.

One of the most vocal critics of the HERO initiative is Frederick Frazier, a Trump-endorsed former state lawmaker who spent nearly 30 years as a Dallas police officer. He asked a question many others have had in the course of WFAA’s reporting: Are Dallas HERO’s local efforts a precursor to similar changes in other cities?

“Are you trying to build a better department? Or are you trying to destroy a city?” Frazier said. “I want to know: Are we the experiment?”

Dallas Violent Crime Down

This summer, Dallas-area hotelier and GOP megadonor Monty Bennett joined a conversation on X Spaces to discuss Dallas HERO’s efforts.

“Every American city in this country of any size is a disaster,” Bennett said in that recorded audio discussion, “and it’s terrible.”

Last year, Bennett confirmed to WFAA that he helped fund the group, formed in 2023. But because it is a nonprofit organization, it’s not required to disclose its donor lists, so it’s unclear how much of its $3 million in donations in 2023 and 2024 came from him. Bennett declined to answer WFAA’s questions about how much he contributed to the group, but his office did provide a copy of the organization’s 2024 990 tax form.

Both before the November election and after, Bennett — who has contributed money to Trump’s presidential campaign and to local conservative political action committees advocating for school vouchers — pushed HERO’s message that Dallas, in particular downtown Dallas, is a dangerous place, frequently via his conservative online news site The Dallas Express.

Bennett lives in Highland Park, an affluent community that’s surrounded by Dallas but boasts its own city government and police force. The headquarters of his hotel company, Ashford Inc., is just outside the city limits in Farmers Branch, a suburb northwest of Dallas.

His messaging fits an idea that conservatives have increasingly pushed. Trump, in announcing his 2024 campaign for president, referred to the “blood-soaked streets of our once great cities,” calling them “cesspools of violent crimes.”

A group called Save Austin Now tried unsuccessfully in 2021 to convince voters in that city to pass an ordinance forcing it to hire hundreds more police officers.

Bennett later met with Matt Mackowiak, a longtime Austin-based Republican strategist who co-founded Save Austin Now. Mackowiak said he spoke to Bennett about Dallas HERO’s messaging and how to collect enough signatures to get its propositions on the November 2024 ballot.

A spokesperson for Bennett told WFAA that Dallas HERO’s efforts were not modeled after Save Austin Now and that Bennett is not affiliated with the Austin group.

According to city police statistics during the 2021 Austin campaign, violent crime rates in that city were up by 5% compared with 2020, although property crime overall was down in 2021 compared with 2020.

In Dallas, however, violent crime is on track to go down for a fifth year in a row. Last year, Dallas had one of its lowest homicide rates in decades, 14 per 100,000 residents, down from 2023’s rate of 19 per 100,000.

Jay Coons, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Sam Houston State University, said Dallas voters in November responded strongly to perceptions about crime — regardless of whether it’s actually declining or on the rise.

“Let’s face it: Fear sells,” Coons said. “If you want people to do something, if you can instill fear, that’s a very powerful motivator.”

But that fear isn’t justified in Dallas, said former interim police Chief Mike Igo.

“To the point of crime is out of control?” Igo said. “It’s not.”

Igo and Frazier are among the unusual collection of voices who opposed the Dallas HERO propositions. The Dallas Police Association, which represents thousands of officers, spoke out against the measures, calling them “contrived by a small group of people who do not live in Dallas, with no open dialogue.” The association’s leaders argued the propositions would affect its ability to negotiate pay raises for all of its officers and had questions about the department’s ability to train so many new officers while retaining current ones. Former police chiefs, all 14 of Dallas’ City Council members at the time, nearly all of the city’s prominent civic and business groups, and at least four former Dallas mayors publicly opposed the measures as well.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, who switched from the Democratic to the Republican party in 2023, lauded HERO’s efforts but still urged voters to reject the propositions.

“Their policy language is deeply flawed, and they would create more problems for the city than they would solve,” Johnson and Cara Mendelsohn, one of the more conservative Dallas City Council members, wrote in an October 2024 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News.

Bennett, who declined an interview request for this story but answered a few questions via email, said he was disappointed in their positions on the measures.

Opponents to the propositions Dallas HERO pushed warned that shackling the city’s budget to such a huge public safety commitment, while at the same time making Dallas vulnerable to lawsuits, could mean cuts to other critical services.

Bennett, in his recent X Spaces conversation, said hiring hundreds of police is simple, though experts have told WFAA it is not.

He also argued that building a new Dallas police academy, which has been in the planning stages for years, is not necessary. He suggested the department instead raise its pay rates in order to hire back officers it had trained but lost to other departments.

Hiring back officers who’ve left for other departments, or recruiting from other departments in general (a practice called lateral hiring that’s regularly employed among police recruiters in Fort Worth, Dallas and other cities across Texas), can indeed be an effective hiring tool, said a police official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the department. But those hires account for only a fraction of the new officers brought on every year. And, after serving in smaller departments, some officers may learn they prefer the slower pace afforded by those jobs, the official said.

Bennett said in an email that the city could hire more officers if it raised their salaries. “The solution to hiring more police officers is to pay them better,” Bennett wrote. “It’s no more complicated than that. Pay them what they’re worth.” He didn’t explain how he thought the city would budget for those increases.

Hiring more police officers has been a goal of the Dallas Police Department for more than two decades, Frazier said. But, he argued, the city doesn’t have enough field trainers, cars or physical spaces to accommodate so many new officers joining its ranks in such a short period of time.

“I would say that would be very difficult,” Frazier said. “I’ve heard a lot of folks say that — ‘We could fix you in a minute.’ No one’s done it.”

The new city budget, which took effect Oct. 1, increased the police department’s minimum starting pay, raising it from about $75,000 to more than $81,000 annually. But that still falls thousands of dollars short of several smaller suburban departments in the area.

According to city reports, DPD had 3,215 officers as of June. The city manager’s goal is to gradually increase that number — but at the current rate, she said, the department won’t reach HERO’s 4,000-officer demand until around 2029.

“It’s a balancing act,” City Manager Kim Tolbert told WFAA during a recent extended sitdown when asked about the impact of the HERO amendments on the budget. “We’re listening, we’re being responsive, but we’re also being good stewards of the public dollar.”

In an email, Bennett wrote, “Government will always blame imposed outside requirements when it has to curb its profligate spending.”

Who Leads Dallas HERO?

WFAA has tried to better understand not just why Dallas HERO’s efforts were successful in the city, but also the motivations of the people behind the initiative. The group bills itself as bipartisan, but at least some of its current and former leaders and associates, like Bennett and Marocco, have championed conservative interests.

HERO’s founding president, Stefani Carter, is a Republican former state representative who is now the lead director on the board of Braemar Hotels & Resorts, a real estate investment trust focused on investing in luxury hotels and resorts. Bennett is Braemar’s founder and chair of its board. (Braemar is for sale, and Carter’s fate on its board is unclear; she did not respond to questions about her status or about the Dallas HERO initiative.)

HERO’s attorney, Art Martinez de Vara, is a municipal lawyer, a historian and the mayor of a small town near San Antonio called Von Ormy, which he helped to incorporate almost 20 years ago as a so-called “liberty city,” operating with minimal levels of government oversight but facing myriad issues including lack of a sewer system. He declined to speak to WFAA about the propositions, citing anticipated litigation.

During the fall campaign to pass the propositions, Marocco led Dallas HERO as its executive director while living in University Park, a self-governed suburban enclave nestled inside Dallas similar to where Bennett calls home. Dallas HERO told WFAA Marocco is no longer with the organization. Trump later tapped Marocco to run USAID, where he wrote the cable ordering a freeze on all U.S. foreign and humanitarian aid, resulting in furloughs and layoffs across the agency.

Marocco did not respond to the news organization’s efforts to reach him.

The man who replaced Marocco in early February as HERO’s executive director, Damien LeVeck, is a horror film director whose social media account Dallas En Fuego trolls city officials with what he refers to as “spicy videos & memes.” He also sells branded merchandise, including a T-shirt with a picture of a Dallas City Council member he often criticizes.

“Show your support for combatting Dallas municipal tyranny (and stupidity) with our great merchandise,” the language on his merch site reads.

All refused to speak with WFAA on camera.

LeVeck provided a statement, on behalf of HERO, that read, in part: “The HERO amendments … decisively passed by voters last November, will boost public safety by expanding the police force and strengthening government accountability. Residents deserve to feel safe where they live and work, and we are committed to ensuring city leadership upholds the will of the voters.”

Coons, who spent nearly four decades with the Harris County sheriff’s office as a patrol commander before entering academia, said even in a city like Dallas with declining violent crime, people can still be scared into making political decisions.

“Whether crime is rampant and people are being murdered in the streets, or whether it’s an extraordinarily safe place to be, the truth probably is going to be a little bit separate than the individual Dallasite’s perception of what’s going on,” he said.

Voters in the city’s more affluent northern side narrowly voted against the measure, with 49.3% voting in favor, an analysis by ProPublica and WFAA found. But in the south, where crime rates are higher and police response times are longer, 52.9% of voters cast ballots in favor.

Dallas City Council member Carolyn King Arnold, who represents part of southern Dallas and was an outspoken opponent of the HERO amendments, said the organization’s backers exploited her constituents’ frustrations over crime in order to get their measures passed.

“In talking to some who actually voted in the southern sector for this, they told me basically, ‘I just want to see one officer ride through, that’s why I voted for it,’ not understanding the full impact of that amendment,” Arnold said. “It’s always about fear.”

It’s not clear what’s next for the Dallas HERO team.

Since its win in November, the group has taken to social media and spoken at City Council meetings to demand more money be devoted to the police department.

“Crime, homelessness, and property destruction is rampant throughout Dallas,” HERO posted on X on Aug. 19.

Within hours of the City Council passing the coming year’s budget, HERO publicly took issue with it. According to a Sept. 18 statement, the organization said the budget “fails to comply with Proposition U.”

Asked about the city’s argument that the budget meets the proposition requirements, Bennett wrote in an email, “With respect, it just doesn’t seem like this is true.”

LeVeck swore in the organization’s Sept. 18 statement that Dallas HERO will “hold city leaders accountable.”

“Sue them into submission!” one X user wrote in response to that promise.

The organization has already threatened to do so.

In December, HERO, citing Proposition S, the immunity measure, argued that the city isn’t enforcing state laws banning people from sleeping in encampments on public property. In March, the group’s attorney sent a letter to the city threatening to sue it for not hiring police fast enough. The city declined to comment about both incidents.

Frazier said he and other local law enforcement stakeholders remain concerned about Dallas HERO’s efforts. While their actions are abundant, their ultimate goals are murky.

“When you ask that question around,” Frazier said, “no one really knows what the end game is.”
