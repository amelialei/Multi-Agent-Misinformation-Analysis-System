1,Anderson Clayton,“North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the south.”,barely-true,"October 29, 2025",press release,"North Carolina Democrats are calling on state legislators to boost public school teacher pay. Arguing its case, the party said Oct. 29 that Tar Heel State teachers draw the South’s lowest salaries. ""North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the South and thanks to the NCGOP’s inability to pass a budget their take home pay continues to decrease while the cost of living and inflation only skyrocket,"" state party Chair Anderson Claytonsaidin a written statement. North Carolina’s legislature primarily funds public school districts, including teacher salaries. The state’s Republican-controlled House and Senate are at an impasse over funding after failing to agree on a long-term spending plan before the current fiscal year’s July 1 start. The state is operating on funding levels in the previous budget, approved in 2023. That means teachers won’t see significant salary increases, unless lawmakers reach an accord. The state Department of Public Instruction, which oversees the state’s public schools, collects data related to public school education and employee salaries. We emailed the department to ask about Clayton’s claim that North Carolina teachers are the ""lowest paid teachers in the South."" A DPI spokesperson told PolitiFact North Carolina that the department doesn’t track pay in other states, and therefore doesn’t know exactly how teacher salaries in North Carolina compare to teacher salaries in other states. The spokesperson instead referred us todata collected by the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union. NEA tracks the average teacher salary in each state, as well as the average salary for teachers who are starting their careers. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, North Carolina’s average teacher salary of $58,292 ranked 43rd in the nation. The state’s average starting salary of $42,542 ranked 39th in the nation. How does that compare to other Southern states? NEA data shows average teacher salaries are lower in Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana than in North Carolina. Starting salaries are lower in Mississippi and Kentucky. A PolitiFact review of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsdatafrom 2024 — the most recent year of complete data available — found average teacher pay to be lower in Mississippi than in North Carolina, as well. PolitiFact asked NEA if there’s any metric showing North Carolina with the lowest teacher pay in the South. Staci Maiers, the association’s spokeswoman, said NEA believes it’s more useful to compare a state to its neighbors than to an entire region. ""It would be more accurate to say that North Carolina teachers are the lowest paid among its neighboring states, behind Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and even South Carolina,"" Maiers said. The NEA numbers include base-level pay set by state lawmakers, as well as supplemental pay provided by local-level governments. Public Schools First NC, a nonprofit organization that researches public education issues, published areportearlier this year that compared teachers’ base pay, among Southern states. The analysis excluded supplemental pay. The group’s comparison, which doesn’t include teacher pay information for Florida or Virginia, found that North Carolina’s base pay for starting teachers to be the lowest of all the other Southern states. North Carolina’s new teachers make base pay of $41,000 annually. The next lowest is Mississippi’s $41,500. Supplemental pay provided in North Carolina’s richest counties could make overall starting salaries look larger than they are, said Public Schools First NC spokesperson Heather Koons. ""In North Carolina, Wake County has a nice, robust local supplement because we have a stronger tax base in Wake County, whereas others don’t,"" Koons said. In comparing each state’s base pay, Koons said: ""We wanted to compare apples to apples."" When we asked Clayton about the NEA data, she responded by email with sarcasm: ""After seeing the data, we’d like to formally apologize to the GOP leadership in the General Assembly for misspeaking and not recognizing that they made sure that North Carolina teachers are not in the bottom 15% for teacher pay but instead, only in the bottom 20."" Clayton said ""North Carolina teachers are already the lowest paid teachers in the South."" Data from the NEA, the largest teachers’ union in the nation, shows North Carolina’s teacher salaries are among the lowest among neighboring states, but not the lowest. Other southern states have lower average teacher salaries and lower starting teacher salaries than North Carolina. The NEA’s data includes both state-level base pay and supplemental pay provided by local governments. If supplemental pay is excluded, North Carolina’s base pay for starting teachers is, indeed, lower than other southern states, according to a North Carolina-based education nonprofit. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

33,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,“It's going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history.”,barely-true,"September 4, 2025",Senate hearing,"At a September Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. boasted about a rural health initiative within President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" ""It's going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history,""Kennedy said,responding to criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders said the law would harm patients and rural hospitals. Kennedy was referring to the law’s five-year, $50 billionRural Health Transformation Program, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. GOP lawmakers have made similar claims about the program. The fund was added to the bill at the last minute to secure support from Republican lawmakers who represent rural states. Some were concerned about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would harm rural America, wheremore than 150 hospitalshave stopped offering inpatient services or been shuttered completely since 2010, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. ""The transformation fund was really talked about in the context of saving rural hospitals that would be facing these significant Medicaid cuts,"" said Carrie Cochran-McClain, National Rural Health Association chief policy officer. Medicaid is the joint state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers low-income people and those with disabilities. So is Kennedy right in his description of the rural health fund as a historic cash infusion, or does it fail to acknowledge critical context? Trump’s tax and spending law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by at least $137 billion by 2034, according to ananalysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. TheCongressional Budget Office predictsthe law will increase the overall number of uninsured patients by 10 million by 2034. Rural health facilities disproportionately rely on Medicaid reimbursement to stay afloat. In 2023, 40.6% of children and 18.3% of adults under age 65 from rural areas and small townswere enrolled in Medicaid, according to the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. In metro areas, the rates were 38.2% and 16.3%, respectively. The Trump administration argues that rural hospitals cannot rely on ""legacy"" funding sources like Medicaid and Medicare due to the programs' reimbursement structure, which ties payments to the number of services provided, a model that’s not financially sustainable for rural facilities with typically low patient volumes. ""Distinct from these other programs, the Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to provide a flexible source of investment"" to promote innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, the White Housewrote in a memo. Here’s how it works: States can propose projects spearheaded by state agencies, health care providers, consultants, and vendors aimed at various purposes, such as improving technology, access to care, and workforce recruitment. States can use only 15% of their transformation program funding for provider payments and can direct money to non-rural areas,according to KFF. Half of the $50 billion will be evenly divided among states whose applications are approved —regardless of their rural and overall populations — according to the ""Notice of Funding Opportunity"" for the program. The other half will be awarded based on ""the transformative possibilities"" of states’ grant proposals; how much they’ve committed to aligning their health policies with the Trump administration’s; and data on their rural population, rural health facilities, uncompensated care, and other measurements. The application deadline is Nov. 5. Michael Meit, director of the Center for Rural Health and Research at East Tennessee State University, said the rural health community is excited about the innovations the new program might foster, but he’d ""love for it to happen in the absence of these cuts that are going to devastate our rural health system."" ""It’s not going to fill the hole,"" Meit said. KFF estimates that the rural health fund’s five-year, $50 billion investment is a little overa third of the expected lossof federal funding in rural areas that will be spread over 10 years. According to that analysis, Medicaid cuts over that period would tally at least $137 billion in rural areas. That number doesn’t account for other reductions stemming from the same law, such as cuts to the ACA Marketplaces or the health-system revenue loss expected from an increase in the number of people without insurance. These factors are important to note because the rural health program is a temporary initiative while reductions in federal spending are long-term. Another issue is the difference in the program’s spirit. The rural health fund is focused on transforming the rural health care system — not providing continued funding to keep facilities open or making up for lost Medicaid funds. Even if it triggers successful innovations, there are doubts that those will happen in time to prevent rural health facilities from closing. ""There's a real misperception that somehow these funds are going to be able to save rural America or save rural hospitals,"" Cochran-McClain said. Joseph Antos, a health policy expert and senior fellow emeritus at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Kennedy’s comment is something ""politicians say when they want to ignore the rest of the policies."" ""What they wanted was to say that they were creating a new program,"" Antos said. ""Well, this is a very inefficient way to distribute a relatively very small amount of money to hospitals that will incur much larger bad debt over the coming years, thanks to the cuts in Medicaid."" Experts said that when viewed outside of mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, the $50 billion rural health fund does appear to be unrivaled, especially for a limited, five-year program. Several mentioned the Hill-Burton Act as another program that significantly boosted rural health care. The law provided loans and grants thatmodernized or built 6,800 health facilities, many of which were in rural areas, from 1946 to 1997, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. Incomplete funding data makes it difficult to account for inflation, said Kelsey Moran, an assistant professor and health economist at the University of Miami. Butshe estimatedthat, during the life of the program, it spent $47 billionin 2024 dollars when using the Consumer Price Index, or $109 billion when using the CPI’s medical care index. The medical index has a higher inflation rate because health prices have risen more than overall prices. Kennedy said the rural health fund is ""going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history."" The statement contains an element of truth because the new program could be the most significant one-time investment in rural health funding. But it ignores critical facts and context that create a different impression. Federal contributions to rural areas from Medicaid and Medicare easily dwarf this program’s $50 billion mark. The new fund offers states flexibility in how they can allocate resources, meaning there’s no guarantee that all the new funding will go to rural Americans’ health care. The program comes at the same time rural areas are expected to lose far more from Medicaid cuts and an increase in uninsured patients than what the rural health fund infusion can backfill. Experts say the rural health fund’s cash infusion is canceled out by other parts of Trump’s tax and spending law that call for cuts and policy changes.

48,Robert Ortt,"During Gov. Hochul’s tenure, there has been “more crime on our streets.”",mostly-true,"August 4, 2025",statement,"A leading Republican called Gov. Kathy Hochul's track record ""abysmal"" on the heels of her recent gubernatorial visit to Western New York. ""The only thing New Yorkers have to show from her tenure are rising prices, increased wasteful spending, skyrocketing Medicaid costs due to fraud and abuse, and more crime on our streets,"" said Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, R-North Tonawanda. Crime increases during the pandemic were well documented, but we wondered if Ortt’s claim of ""more crime on our streets"" since Hochul became governor on Aug. 24, 2021, is accurate. New York state keeps track of seven ""index crimes"" for a reporting system developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Four of them are violent crimes: murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The other three are property crimes: burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Statewide datashow the number of crimes and the crime rate are up from 2021. From the first full year that Hochul held office, 2022, the count is higher but the rate is not. Hochul took office in August 2021, and during that whole year, there were 345,980 index crimes in New York state, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services. In 2022, the first full year that Hochul was in office, the count increased to 423,815. The number of crimes rose to 440,771 in 2023 but fell to 424,312 in 2024. So the 2024 tally remained slightly above the 2022 count and well above the 2021 number. The 2024 crime rate – the number of crimes measured against the population –  increased compared to the 2021 rate but fell compared to the 2022 rate. There were 2,136 reported crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2024, compared to 1,744 in 2021. But compared to 2022, the 2024 crime rate fell by less than 1%. We asked Ortt’s office for evidence of his claim, and to clarify what geography he based his claim on. He had statewide crime in mind, pointing to a2022 reportfrom the Office of the State Comptroller, which showed an increase in index crimes that year. ""Senator Ortt’s statement reflects a documented, sustained increase in crime during Gov. Hochul’s administration,"" said Director of Communications Matthew Mosher. The crime statistics during Hochul’s tenure have ups and downs, not a sustained increase. Ortt’s office also said he was referring to an increase in local crime. His office provided two news stories aboutrising car thefts in Western New York. In Amherst, car thefts have nearlydoubled in the last five years. Statewide statistics show the rate of motor vehicle thefts has increased by 45% since 2021, though it has trended down by 19% from 2023 to 2024. The number of reported index crimes in Western New York was 2,017 for every 100,000 residents in 2021; 2,211 in 2022; and 2,257 in 2024. The data for  Western New York includes Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties. We asked Hochul’s office about Ortt's claim, and her spokesperson referred to index crime data, as well as data that shows that shootings are down 19% this year through July 13, compared to last year. Her office also said shootings on record are at a historic low in New York City, and that outside of the city, New York is 10% below the previous lowest number of shootings. In 2024, shooting incidents with injury fell to the lowest point since the state started keeping count in 2006, the office said. Statewide, violent crimes are up from 2021, but have been falling since 2022. Jillian Snider, a former New York City police officer and policy director for criminal justice and civil liberties at R Street Institute, which supports limited government and free markets, said crime statistics and people’s feelings of relative safety can vary widely across the state. In addition, about half of crimes go unreported. ""This New York State index crime is only reflective of crimes where police are taking an active report,"" Snider said. State data show more crime in 2024 than in 2021, though that isn’t true in every county, Snider said. Ames Grawert, a lawyer who has written about crime trends and bail reform at the Brennan Center, said that like many states, New York saw some types of crime rise during the first years of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Some of those trends have begun to decline. Murder, for example, is down sharply statewide since peaking in 2021,"" Grawert said. The number of murders statewide has fallen sharply since 2021, and the rate has fallen by 29%. In Niagara County, Ortt’s home county, the number of crimes and the crime rate is lower now than in 2021. There were 3,852 crimes in 2021 and 3,259 in 2024, a decrease of 15%. The rate is also down by 15.6%. The crime rates of counties are calculated by dividing the number of index crimes by a county's population and multiplying by 100,000. Ortt claimed Hochul has presided over an increase in crime over her tenure. The rate of index crimes across the state is higher than when Hochul took office in 2021, but slightly lower than her first full year in office. Crime rates vary by place, and looking at specific crimes or specific jurisdictions yields different trends. The Hochul administration focused on reductions in shootings. The crime rate in Ortt’s own county has fallen since 2021. As for all index crimes statewide, Ortt’s statement is accurate but needs additional information.

57,X posts,“North Carolina has just approved a law permitting foreign doctors to practice without completing U.S. training or licensing exams.”,barely-true,"August 16, 2025",X post,"Some North Carolinians are sounding the alarm about a new law that would make it easier for foreign-trained doctors to treat patients in rural parts of the state. ""North Carolina has just approved a law permitting foreign doctors to practice without completing U.S. training or licensing exams,"" said an Aug. 16X postviewed 1.4 million times. The X account that posted the claim has more than 700,000 followers and says it posts ""parody at times."" It didn’t respond to a request for supporting evidence. The post likely referred to a program created byHouse Bill 67, a 48-page state healthcare reform bill that Gov. Josh Stein signed into law on July 1 after it unanimously passed in the state’s House and Senate. The law aims to boost the number of doctors in North Carolina’s rural areas, which it defines as counties with fewer than 500 people per square mile. It allows the North Carolina Medical Board to issue an ""internationally-trained physician employee license"" to immigrants who meet certain conditions. The social media post, which was shared more than 10,000 times, prompted concern among other X users about foreign-trained doctors’ qualifications. It also led to social mediaspatsbetween X users andsomestatelawmakers. But the basis for those concerns was faulty. Ninety-three of North Carolina’s 100 counties have a shortage of primary care providers, according to 2024data released this yearby the state and federal governments. The X post claimed that applicants could practice medicine ""without completing U.S. training or licensing exams."" That’s not true, according to the North Carolina Medical Board’s review of the law. Let’s go through some of the eligibility requirements. An applicant must have a job offer from a rural North Carolina hospital or medical practice  where a fully-licensed physician must also practice on-site. An applicant can’t begin work in North Carolina until receiving legal approval, and they can’t obtain a full license to practice medicine until they practice in rural North Carolina for four years. They must also have a current and active license in good standing to practice medicine in a foreign country or one that expired within the five years prior. They have to have completed 130 weeks of medical education at a school in theWorld Dictionary of Medical Schools. So where do the U.S. exams come in?Applicants must be eligible to be certified by theEducational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a division of the Philadelphia-based medical-education nonprofitIntealththat verifies credentials, registration and licensing. To be eligible for certification bythat commission, applicants must pass Step 1 and Step 2 of the three-step United States Medical Licensing Examination. Intealthrefersto ECFMG certification as ""a rigorous process, evaluating medical knowledge using the same examinations taken by U.S. medical school graduates."" The commission’s eligibility requirements aren’t spelled out in the bill, which may be why the required U.S. tests have gone overlooked by some who read it.The first part of the examassesseswhether aspiring physicians can understand and apply important concepts of the sciences basic to the practice of medicine. The second part measures the applicant’s ability to apply medical knowledge and skills. Some could argue that because applicants aren’t obtaining a full license from the commission, they aren’t ""completing"" an exam. The commission’sexammaterials, though, refer to each of the steps as individual exams. And by completing those two alone, applicants qualify for ECFMC certification. Applicants are also required to demonstrate ""competency"" to practice medicine. They could do this by passing tests administered by U.S.-based groups, such as the National Board of Medical Examiners, the United States Medical Licensing Examination, or the Federation Licensing Examination. Or they could pass tests administered by international groups. The law says applicants can pass a licensing exam from certain countries that are members of the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities. They can also receive speciality board certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada or any other speciality certification group recognized by North Carolina’s Medical Board. Jean Brinkley, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Medical Board, said any suggestion that the board would approve minimally-trained physicians is ""patently absurd."" ""We hold the keys to the kingdom pretty tightly in North Carolina,"" Brinkley told PolitiFact. ""We’re going to make sure that anyone who is licensed to practice in North Carolina is competent."" The post said ""North Carolina has just approved a law permitting foreign doctors to practice without completing U.S. training or licensing exams."" In order to qualify for an ""internationally-trained physician employee license"" from the North Carolina Medical Board, applicants must be eligible to be certified by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. That certification requires applicants to pass Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. The law doesn’t require applicants to obtain a license from the United States Medical Licensing Examination, so some could argue that applicants aren’t ""completing"" an exam. The commission’sexammaterials, though, refer to each of the steps as individual exams. And by completing those two alone, applicants qualify for certification from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates — a U.S.-based medical-education group that verifies credentials, registration and licensing.

58,Michael Whatley,Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper “bears direct responsibility” for the fatal stabbing of a woman on the Charlotte rail system.,false,"September 6, 2025",X post,"Republicans are trying to blame North Carolina’s former governor for policies that, they say, enabled a fatal stabbing on Charlotte’s rail system. DeCarlos Brown Jr. faces state and federal murder charges in the death of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian who moved to Charlotte in 2022 after Russia invaded her home country. Video of the Charlotte attack shows a man with a knife rising from his seat on a light-rail train and then slashing the neck of Zarutska, who was sitting in the row in front of him. Police later identified the assailant as Brown. The video prompted calls to action from a wide range of officials, with many Republicans — including President Donald Trump — pointing the finger at former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who’s running for North Carolina’s open U.S. Senate seat. Among the strongest accusations came from Michael Whatley, a Trump-backed Republican running for the seat. ""DeCarlos Brown Jr., a dangerous career criminal, should have been behind bars years ago, but my opponent Roy Cooper's lenient 2020 executive order kept him on the streets, endangering communities. In June 2020, Cooper signed a soft-on-crime executive order, and just three months later, Brown was released from prison,"" Whatley said in a Sept. 6X post. Whatley went on to say that Brown was arrested and released three additional times between 2021 and 2025, taking ""full advantage of Cooper's weak policies."" ""Cooper bears direct responsibility for this heinous act and must answer to the public about why he prioritizes criminals over public safety,"" Whatley’s post concluded. Asked for evidence that Cooper ""bears direct responsibility"" in the killing, Whatley’s campaign cited atask force Cooper createdin 2020 that recommended changes to the criminal justice system, such as implementing cashless bail for some misdemeanors where there's no risk to public safety. Cooper told the group at the time that he looked forward to implementing their recommendations. ""And just three short months after Cooper made that pledge to implement these soft-on-crime policies, violent offender DeCarlos Brown Jr. was back on the streets, looking for his next victim,"" said Jonathan Felts, a Whatley campaign spokesperson. Brown was released from prison in 2020. However, PolitiFact found no evidence that the task force or its recommendations played a role in Brown’s release that year or earlier this year. He had served his full sentence at the time of his 2020 release. Daniel Roberts, a lawyer for Brown, didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.WCNC reportedSept. 10 that Roberts released a statement saying that he planned to limit his public statements, citing an ethics code. Brown has been arrested at least 14 times, most between 2011 and 2014. PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, WRAL News,reported on Brown’s recordover that period. For most of that time, Republican Pat McCrory was governor, Cooper was attorney general, and Republican Andrew Murray was the local district attorney. Court records show Murray’s office dismissed several charges against Brown during that period — including for communicating threats — but that he also was convicted of several other crimes. A 2013 guilty plea for shoplifting brought no prison time. Neither did a conviction for breaking and entering and larceny. The latter charge, though, landed Brown on probation, which he violated by committing an armed robbery, according to court records. Armed robbery is a Class D felony, which can carry a sentence of13 years in prison, depending on a defendant’s criminal record. Brown pleaded guilty to robbery with a dangerous weapon in 2014. A judge sentenced him to more than six years in prison, and Murray’s office dropped a related charge of possession of a firearm by a felon. Brown got credit for 176 days in jail while awaiting trial and then served five-and-a-half years in prison, police andcourt recordsshow. Brown then had one year of post-release supervision after prison, which ended in September 2021. Whatley’s campaign noted that Brown was released in September, three months afterCooper createdthe stateTask Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice. But the report had no bearing on Brown’s release from prison. Brown served 100% of his sentence and was not released early or paroled, the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction told PolitiFact. And the task force didn’t publish itsrecommendationsuntil December 2020 — three months after Brown had already been released. Whatley’s post said that Brown has been arrested and released additional times since 2021, and that Brown was ""taking full advantage of Cooper's weak policies."" The task force’s report called on the criminal justice system to eliminate cash bail for certain misdemeanors and promote alternatives to arrest. But the report’s recommendations were nonbinding. Most of the recommendations would have required the Republican-controlled state Legislature to enact them, and lawmakers did not. Further, North Carolina governors don’t have any power over who goes to prison. They have some power over who gets out because they can issue pardons or commutations. Cooper, who was governor from 2017 through 2024, did no such thing for Brown. Charlotte-Mecklenburg police arrested Brown three times between 2022 and 2024, but none of those arrests led to charges,WBTV reported. Tracey Brown, the suspect’s sister,told CNNthat Brown bit her and broke the hinges of a door in 2022, but that she did not seek charges. She said Brown had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered hallucinations and paranoia, and that the family hoped to get him psychiatric help. In January, Brown was arrested and charged with misusing the 911 emergency dispatch system and released without bail on the promise to appear in court. It’s common for courts to release someone without requiring them to post bail when the charge involved is a nonviolent misdemeanor. Misusing the 911 system is aClass 1 misdemeanorthat carries a maximum penalty of 120 days in jail, statesentencing documentsshow. So even if Brown had been given the maximum sentence in January, the sentence likely would have ended before Aug. 22, the day Brown is alleged to have stabbed Zarutska. Court records show that Brown’s trial in the 911 case was postponed on multiple occasions. A March hearing was continued for ""case management."" In June, the defense filed a motion for Brown to undergo a forensic evaluation. The judge granted the order on July 29. Queen City Newsreportedthat, despite the order, Brown was never evaluated. Whatley joined North Carolina legislative leaders for a Sept. 11 press briefing in Raleigh about the stabbing, where he again said Cooper’s policies ""allowed attacks like that on Iryna."" At the briefing, a reporter asked Senate Leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, which of the task force’s recommendations contributed to Zarutska’s death. Berger didn’t provide an answer. Instead, he noted that the recommendations had been posted on the internet and could have been used as a reference point for judges and magistrates. The task force recommendations ""reflect an attitude on policing, an attitude on criminal justice, an attitude on how things ought to be taking place,"" Berger said. ""And those attitudes, in many respects, are the things that inform the kinds of decisions that were made by the magistrate in this case and by other magistrates that are of the same political ilk."" PolitiFact asked the Mecklenburg County judicial district whether the magistrate who released Brown used the task force’s recommendations as a guide. North Carolina Judicial Branch policy discourages the courts from commenting on active cases, said Natalie McKinney, a spokesperson for the district. She added: ""As it relates to bond determinations and pretrial release, generally, the Judges and Magistrates in the 26th Judicial District operate according to the U.S. Constitution, North Carolina Constitution, North Carolina General Statutes and local policy."" Neither Berger nor Whatley produced any evidence that the magistrate consulted the task force’s recommendations before releasing Brown after his January arrest. Whatley said Cooper ""bears direct responsibility"" for the murder of Zarutska. Cooper was not involved in Brown’s case in January, when he was released after his arrest for misusing the 911 system. Whatley’s campaign cited the recommendations of a task force Cooper created in 2020 — the same year Brown was released from prison for armed robbery. But the task force didn’t release its recommendations until after Brown had already been released from prison. And the state’s correction system said Brown served his full term; he wasn’t released early or paroled. Further, the task force’s report is merely a set of recommendations. The report’s call to introduce cashless bail is nonbinding, and there’s no evidence it played a role in Brown’s release from jail while awaiting trial for charges that he misused the 911 system.

87,John Blust,“Democrats have 24 more seats (in Congress) than they would have if illegal aliens were not counted in the census.”,false,"June 13, 2025",email,"A North Carolina Republican has a theory about why Democrats oppose a bill requiring state and local government agencies to help detain people wanted by federal immigration officials. Republicans in the GOP-controlled General Assembly hope to enact the bill, known as the ""North Carolina Border Protection Act"", after Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed it in June. They overrode Stein’s veto in the state Senate; the House of Representatives has yet to vote on an override. State Rep.John Blust, a Guilford County Republican, said during the bill’s June 4 House debate that Democrats benefit from having a large population of people in the U.S. illegally. ""I keep thinking, 'Why are they [Democrats] choosing this hill to die on?’,""Blust said. ""And then I read a few weeks ago that: Because they count illegal aliens in the census, the Republican majority would be 27 seats in the Congress instead of three."" What is Blust talking about? Every 10 years, Congress redistributes the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives based on each state’s population. States gain or lose seats based on population estimates calculated by the U.S. Census. For example, the 2020 census showed North Carolina population growth, leading it to gain a fourteenth congressional seat; New York lost a seat due to population decline. Census-takers measure only the number of people living in the U.S; they aren’t responsible for determining a person’s legal status. President Donald Trumptried to changethat prior to the 2020 census, but the Supreme Court blocked an effort to add a citizenship question to the national survey. On Aug. 7, Trumpsaidon Truth Socialthat people without legal status would not be included in census data. Blust said the practice of including immigrants illegally in the U.S. benefits states with more liberal populations. One note about Blust’s original statement about the GOP’s majority in the U.S. House: the party’s edge has fluctuated as members have died or resigned. In an email responding to PolitiFact’s question about his comments, Blust clarified his claim. ""I have read that Democrats have 24 more seats than they would have if illegal aliens were not counted in the census,"" he wrote in a June 13 email. Blust said he couldn’t remember where he read the statistic about Congressional apportionment and provided no evidence to support his claim. PolitiFactfact-checkedthe theory about congressional apportionment last year after similar claims by billionaire Elon Musk, Republican congressmen, and Trump adviser Stephen Miller. Some alleged that immigrants in the country illegally accounted for 22 U.S. House seats based on population estimates by theFederation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for reduced immigration. The federation claimed in a 2023 report that the U.S. was home to about 16.8 million such immigrants as of that June. Some people took that 16.8 million number and divided it by761,169— the number of people each congressional seat represents — to arrive at the math for 22 affected House seats. But PolitiFact found the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s data isflawedbecause it likely overcounted the number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Other groups estimate a lower population of immigrants in the country illegally, ranging from 10.5 million to about11 million. TheCenter for Immigration Studies, which also advocates for less immigration, has published new reports on the immigrant population sincelast year’s PolitiFact report. That group’s findings don’t support Blust’s claim, either. The center estimated that the U.S. is home to21.6 million noncitizens, about half of whom are here illegally. It said that noncitizens — regardless of immigration status — created a net gain of14 U.S. House seatsin Democratic-leaning states in 2020. Migrants in the U.S. illegally likely affectedtwo U.S. House seatsin 2020, the group reported. If the census were retaken in 2024, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated, migrants in the U.S. illegally would affect seven states by shiftingfour U.S. House seats: seats in Minnesota, Oregon, Ohio, and Tennessee would be redistributed to Arizona, California and Texas (which would get two new seats). Other groups say that unauthorized immigrants have a much smaller effect on U.S. House seats. The Pew Research Center reported in 2020 thatthree seats would shiftif unauthorized immigrants were excluded from that year’s census. California, Texas and Florida would lose a seat, while Alabama, Ohio and Minnesota would have gained one seat each. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said in aJanuary 2024 reportthat noncitizen populations — both legal immigrants and immigrants in the country illegally — primarily increased in Republican-led states between 2019 and 2023. Cato said red states gained an estimated 1.2 million noncitizens while blue states gained about 72,000. Cato researcher David Bier, the report’s author, told PolitiFact North Carolina in a telephone interview that Blust’s claim is ""very wrong"" and that he’s not aware of any credible study that supports Blust’s claim. Astudypublished in January found that including immigrants in the U.S. illegally in census data has had ""minimal"" impact on party representations of the U.S. House of Representatives. The study was conducted by University of Minnesota researcherRob WarrenandRobert E. Warren, a former demographer for the U.S. Census who’s now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank studying international migration. If immigrants in the U.S. illegally were excluded from the 2020 census, California and Texas would have each lost one seat in the 2020 House and those seats would have been given to Ohio and New York instead, Warren and Warren reported. ""Even if we were to make the most extreme possible assumption — that every ‘lost’ seat would have cost Democrats and every ‘gained’ seat would have benefitted Republicans — the number of seats switching parties could never have exceeded five,"" they wrote in their study. Brian Gaines, a University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign political science professor, said excluding migrants in the country illegally from the census would likely cause ""a small increase in the Republican share of U.S. House seats."" However, he said, Blust’s estimate of 24 seats is ""implausibly high."" Blust said Democrats have ""24 more seats"" in the U.S. House than they would have if immigrants in the U.S. illegally weren’t counted in the census. Blust didn’t provide any evidence to support his claim. Estimates by researchers and advocacy groups show that immigrants in the U.S. illegally likely affect congressional apportionment — but not by as many seats as Blust said, and not benefitting Democrats as much as Blust said. At least one study shows Republican-led states benefitting more than states led by Democrats.

The administration says the president cooled hostilities by leveraging both the U.S. military and economic pressure. His supportersarguehis actions are worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize, something Trump has sought for years.""I’ve stopped six wars — I’m averaging about a war a month,""Trump said July 28in Turnberry, Scotland. He has repeated a version of the line about 10 times.Trump and his team cite his diplomacy between Israel and Iran; the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda; Cambodia and Thailand; India and Pakistan; Serbia and Kosovo; and Egypt and Ethiopia. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Trump had ""direct involvement in these conflicts, leveraging tools from America’s military might to our superior consumer market."" Missing from his list is theRussia-Ukraine war, which he pledged to end within 24 hoursof taking office, and the Israel-Hamas war. Foreign policy experts said Trump deserves some credit for recent peace agreements in several conflicts. They cited conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand, Israel and Iran, and India and Pakistan, although India disputes Trump’s involvement. But ""the others strike me as major exaggerations or very premature,"" Michael O’Hanlon, Brookings Institution director of research and foreign policy senior fellow, said. ""But it’s still not a bad record, especially if someday he can add Ukraine to the list, while avoiding war in East Asia as well."" The peace agreement between Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda is temporary and shaky. With Egypt and Ethiopia, there is no deal on the table. With Kosovo and Serbia, there’s little evidence he was significantly involved or that a major conflict was emerging. India and Pakistan: U.S. influence is disputedIndia and Pakistan’s leadersagreed to a ceasefireMay 10 after days of military strikes between the two nuclear-armed countries. The conflict centered around the territorial dispute over Kashmir, a region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. India controls the central and southern portions and Pakistan controls the northern and western parts. The countries have fought over the territory since1947. Trumpsaidthe deal was reached after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by the U.S. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifthanked Trumpfor his ""leadership and proactive role.""But Indian leaders disputed that Trump’s intervention factored into the ceasefire. Hours after Trump took credit for the agreement, India Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram MisriannouncedMay 10 that Pakistan’s director general of military operations had initiated a call with his Indian counterpart and both sides agreed to ""stop all firing and military action on land and in the air and sea."" He did not mention the United States. On July 30, India External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar rejected third-party mediation in the ceasefire, and saidno foreign leaderasked India to halt its military operations.Israel and Iran: Ended with US bunker-busting bombOn June 13, Israel launched surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities that killed prominent politicians, military leaders and nuclear scientists. Iran responded with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites. Israel’s goal of eliminating Iran’s nuclear capabilities led toU.S. involvementsince it required bombing Iran’s heavily reinforced facilities atFordo, where its uranium enrichment facility is buried deep underground. Trump authorized the U.S. military to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo, on June 21.On June 24, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire mediated by the U.S. and Qatar. Trumpannounced the dealon Truth Social on June 23: ""It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE."" Experts said it’s difficult to know how much influence Trump had in the talks but said his decision to bomb Iran likely ended the conflict more quickly. The Israelis would have carried out their own attack targeting the facility if the U.S. had not, said Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank. An Israeli attack ""would not have been as quick or as definitive,"" Levitt said. The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda: Trump-brokered deal follows broken dealsOn June 27, the foreign ministers of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congosigneda U.S.-brokered peace agreement in Washington, D.C., to end their deadly, nearly 30-year conflict. Trumpcalledthe moment ""a glorious triumph for the cause of peace"" in an Oval Office event. The agreement also allows for U.S. investment in eastern DRC’s critical mineral reserves, including gold, copper and lithium.The deal is an effort to stop violence in the eastern part of the DRC, where the militia group M23 occupies large swaths of territory. Countriesincluding the United Stateshave accused Rwanda of backing the militia, which Rwanda has consistently denied. The conflict has recently caused thousands of deaths, and about 6 million deaths have been attributed to it over the last 30 years,according to the Council on Foreign Relations.Foreign policy experts said the agreement is significant but part of a long string of broken agreements between the countries.""Over the past year and a half, high-level mediators from the United States, Angola, Kenya, Qatar, Togo and the African Union, among others, have brought the parties back to the negotiating table time and again,"" Cecily Brewer, senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit funded by Congress that promotes conflict resolution and prevention,said in a July 3 report. As tension between DRC and Rwanda intensified in 2023, the U.S.renewedits efforts to broker peace and the countries eventually committed to de-escalate. In mid-2024, the parties agreed to a long-term ceasefire before itcollapsedin December 2024, and M23rampagedthrough eastern DRC.Brewer said long-term peace can only be achieved if the U.S. and other mediators provide consistent monitoring and tangible consequences.Kosovo and Serbia: Little evidence Trump thwarted an escalation OnJune 27, Trump said Serbia and Kosovo were on the verge of war.""Serbia was — they were getting ready to go to war with a group. I won't even mention, because it didn’t happen, we were able to stop it,"" Trump said at anOval Office press conference. ""But I have a friend in Serbia, and they said, 'we're going to go to war again.' And I won’t mention that it's Kosovo, but it's Kosovo. But they were going to have a big time war, and we stopped it. We stopped it because of trade. They want to trade with the United States and I said we don't trade with people that go to war."" Trump hascontinued to sayhe stopped a new conflict between the countries without providing more details. Kosovo backed up Trump’s account, but Serbia denied it had war plans. On July 10, Kosovo President Vjosa OsmanisaidTrump recently had prevented a potential escalation ""from Serbia"" on Kosovo’s border. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučićsaid July 12that Serbia has ""not engaged any soldiers, we have not moved any machinery, it does not even occur to us ... regarding Vjosa Osmani, that we are supposedly preparing for conflicts."" Outside of the leaders’ comments, we did not find evidence of an impending escalation, or that Trump helped snuff it out. Egypt and Ethiopia: No solution on the table over Nile dam disputeThe conflict started over a water dispute. Egypt and Sudan say an Ethiopian-constructed Nile River dam could rob them of their share of water.The $4 billion hydroelectric Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam began construction in 2011and was recently completed. Trump, who failed to broker a deal between the countries during his first term, promised again to work on a solution. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr AbdelattyannouncedJune 29 that talks with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam have officially stalled,according to Egyptian Streets. ""After 12 years of talks, the negotiations have yielded no concrete outcomes,"" Abdelatty said.Trump decided to weigh in a few weeks later at aJuly 14 White House meeting. ""I think if I’m Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile and we’re working on that one, it's a problem, but it’s going to get solved,"" he said.. ""It’s a very important source of income and life, it’s the life of Egypt, and to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we are going to have that solved very quickly.""Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, a Trump ally, praised Trump’s commentJuly 15, saying it ""demonstrates the seriousness of the United States — under President Trump’s leadership — in exerting efforts to resolve conflicts and end wars."" But Ethiopianofficials and expertssaid his remarks risked aggravating the fragile situation and undermining Ethiopia’s right to utilize its natural resources. A similar incidentoccurred in 2020when Trump said the dam could be ""blown up"" by Egypt when Ethiopia didn’t make a deal with the downstream nations. ""I had a deal done for them, and then unfortunately, Ethiopia broke the deal which it should not have done,"" Trump said.""President Trump held grudges against Ethiopia for not adhering to his self-styled mediation efforts between Ethiopia and Egypt eight years ago during his first presidency,"" Fekahmed Negash, former executive director at the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office of the Nile Basin Initiative, toldThe Reporter, an Ethiopian newspaper, July 19. ""The Egyptians got the better of him to take a stand that Ethiopia should sign a binding treaty with Egypt and Sudan regarding the GERD."" He said Ethiopia cannot sign such a deal.Cambodia and Thailand: U.S.-backed talks result in temporary ceasefire On July 28, Cambodia and Thailandagreedto a ceasefire after a territorial dispute escalated into an armed conflict July 24, killing dozens of people and displacing more than 300,000. It marked the deadliest conflict between the two nations in more than a decade.On July 26, Trumpsaidhe was speaking with both countries' leaders and that the U.S. would not negotiate trade deals with either country unless the fighting stopped.U.S.-backed talks began July 28, the same day the ceasefire was announced. Trump said he instructed his team to restart trade negotiations. Both countries agreed not to deploy more troops to their contested border.Experts have questionedhow long the deal will hold since it didn’t address the underlying dispute about which country can lay claim to 1,000-year-old Hindu temples along the 500-mile border.Officials were scheduled to meet Aug. 4 to discuss how to maintain the ceasefire. Trump said he has ""stopped six wars"" since he took office in late January. There’s a lot of uncertainty around Trump’s role in these conflicts. Experts said he deserves some credit for deals that eased conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand, Israel and Iran, and India and Pakistan, although some leaders dispute his role.The U.S. was involved in a temporary peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda that experts said is significant but shaky. In a conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia, there is no solution on the table. And with Kosovo and Serbia, there is little evidence a potential war was brewing.Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

94,Josh Stein,“Guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina.”,mostly-true,"June 6, 2025",X post,"North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein faced pushback on social media over a claim about his state’s gun violence. ""Guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina,"" Stein said in a June 6poston the social media platform X. The claim is relevant to current political debates. State lawmakers recently voted to override Stein’s veto of House Bill 193, allowing private school teachers and others to bring guns on campus. Republican legislators hope to also override Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 50, which would allow people as young as 18 to carry concealed handguns without training or a background check. Stein talked about guns being the leading cause of children’s deaths just before the state House voted on the repeal of concealed carry rules that also lowers the age limit to have handguns from 21 to 18. Social media users questioned whether Stein’s post was accurate, and some asked for data to back his claim. Our review of research shows Stein’s claim has merit, with one caveat: For the bulk of children — those ages 1 to 17 — guns are the top, fatal culprit. When infants under 1 are included in the tally, prenatal conditions become the leading cause of death. ""More than 1,400 North Carolina children died in 2023, the most recent data available from the state, including 102 who died from gunshot wounds. That’s less than the number of infants who died from childbirth complications, which was 448. But among children 1-17, no other cause claimed more than 100 lives."" Stein’s communications team cited a February 2025reportby theNorth Carolina Child Fatality Task Force, which cataloged data from 2023. The task force, created in 1991, examines information surrounding the deaths of children up to age 17. Thegroupincludes members appointed by the Democratic governor and Republican legislative leaders. Many of its members work in fields related to health care, law enforcement or social services. We also examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which researches causes of death. For North Carolina children ages 1 through 17,CDC datafor 2023 show that firearm-related injuries were the leading cause of death. In North Carolina, the CDC logged 100 deaths related to firearms — just ahead of motor vehicle accidents, which caused 96 deaths. Firearm-related deaths were also the leading cause of fatalities for the 1-though-17 age group in 2022, according to ananalysis of CDC databy researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The state task force’s report lays out a couple of ways of measuring death data. In its executive summary, the task force lists ""injuries"" as the top cause of death for children ages 1 through 17. Under the injury category, motor accidents killed the most people: 99. Homicide caused 78 deaths and suicide was the cause of 59. The report goes on to say, though, that the number of deaths caused by guns — either by homicide or suicide — surpasses the number of deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents. Of the combined 137 homicides and suicides in 2023, 102 were committed with a firearm. That number is down from 2022, when there were 108 gun-related child fatalities, but up from totals reported from 2014 to 2019, according to the task force report. In the six years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, gun-related child fatalities ranged from 38 to 62 per year. Gun-related child fatalities then surged to 109 in 2020 and to 121 in 2021. That’s why Stein’sproposed state budget, released in March, requested more than $2.3 million to promote safe gun storage, his office said. The GOP-controlled General Assembly hasn’t taken up Stein’s proposed budget and is unlikely to do so. When infants are included in the data, the top cause of death changes. For all children — from birth through age 17 — the top cause of death in North Carolina was perinatal conditions, according to both state and federal data. The state’s task force documented 448 deaths related to childbirth — conditions such as low birthweight and birth defects. The CDC reported 446 deaths related to childbirth in North Carolina in 2023, a higher toll than any other cause of death. However, researchers havetold PolitiFactthat they often exclude infants when analyzing ""child"" fatalities because infants can suffer from conditions that are unique to children who are younger than 12 months. ""Infant mortality has distinct leading causes, such as congenital conditions and perinatal complications, which differ significantly from the causes of death among older children and adolescents, including firearm injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and cancer,"" Cassandra Crifasi, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact in an email. ""By excluding infants and focusing on children ages 1–17, researchers can better identify and compare the leading external causes of death relevant to injury prevention and public health strategies for this age group,"" Crifasi said. In a news release issued the same day of Stein’s social media post, the governor differentiated gun deaths from fatalities suffered by infants. He said firearms are the leading cause of ""injury-related death"" for children in the state. Stein said ""guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina."" State and CDC data support Stein’s claim for children ages 1 through 17. When infants are considered, perinatal conditions become the top cause of death for all children under 18 years old. But researchers often exclude infants from datasets on child fatalities because infants suffer from conditions that other children don’t. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/aug/05/josh-stein/is-north-carolina-gov-josh-stein-right-about-gun-r/,Unknown,0,1,0,2,0,0

133,John Thune,"“A lot of times, health care comes with a job.”",half-true,"May 30, 2025",interview with KOTA,"Millions of peopleare expectedto lose access to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace health insurance plans if federal lawmakers approve the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, which is now moving through the Senate. Senate Majority Leader John Thune discussed health care and the pending legislation in aninterview with KOTA, a South Dakota TV station. But he focused on a different kind of health insurance — employer-sponsored insurance. ""A lot of times, health care comes with a job,"" Thune said. Thune’s comments in the interview were made in the context of highlighting part of the GOP’s economic policy objective. ""Creating those better paying jobs that come with benefits is ultimately the goal here,"" he said. KFF Health News reached out to Thune’s office to find out the basis for this comment. His communications director, Ryan Wrasse, responded by reiterating Thune’s message: ""Getting a job has the potential to lead a worker to acquiring health care."" Paul Fronstin, director of health benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said Thune’s comment may also be alluding to discussions surrounding Medicaid work requirements. The One Big Beautiful Bill Actwould let nondisabled adultsenroll in Medicaid only if they prove they’re volunteering, working, or searching or training for work. Medicaid, funded by the federal government and states, is the country’s main health insurance program for people with low incomes. Some people with disabilities also qualify. Some Republicans have built on the jobs talking point in defending the Medicaid cuts and work requirements. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., for instance,told CNBCthe bill isn’t about ""kicking people off Medicaid. It’s transitioning from Medicaid to employer-provided health care."" But the health policy experts we checked with made clear that getting a job isn’t a guarantee for getting work-sponsored insurance. These experts said most jobs do offer health insurance. But they also said the link between employment and work-based coverage is not always straightforward. ""When I see this statement, I’m like, ‘I’ve got so much more to say about this.’ But I'm not arguing with the statement,"" Fronstin said. Matthew Rae, an associate director focused on researching private insurance at KFF, a health policy nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, also weighed in. ""Employer-sponsored coverage remains the bedrock of how people get health insurance in the United States,"" Rae said. ""I would say that getting a job is not a guarantee you’re going to have health insurance. It just increases your chances of getting it."" About 60% of Americans younger than 65 receive health insurance through their job or as the spouse, child, or other dependent of someone insured through their work,according to 2023 KFF data. Among workers ages 18 to 64 who were eligible but didn’t sign up for their workplace insurance, 28% said the reason they decided not to enroll was that the plans were too expensive,2023 KFF datashowed. Most of these workers found health insurance elsewhere, such as through a relative’s workplace plan. But a small percentage of eligible employees, 3.7%,were uninsured. Health insurance has been ""the most valued benefit in the workplace"" since businessesbegan offering itto recruit employees in a tight labor market during World War II, Fronstin said. Federal law also encourages companies to offer plans. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more full-time workersare penalizedif they don’t offer most employees insurance that the federal government considers affordable. As of last year, 54% of companies offered health insurance to at least some employees,according to KFF. But that’s not the main way theACA helped lower the rateof people without health insurance, said Melissa Thomasson, a a professor at Miami University in Ohio who specializes in the economic history of health insurance. ""Nearly all of that"" change, she said, came from the ACA creating private marketplace plans and allowing states to expand Medicaid eligibility. Health policy analystssay the One Big Beautiful Bill would make it more difficult for people to qualify or afford marketplace plans, with proposals that would increase paperwork, shorten enrollment periods, and allow enhanced tax credits to fizzle out. Thomasson also noted that political rhetoric surrounding jobs and health insurance doesn’t always align. ""We often talk about small businesses being the engine of job creation,"" but those are the businesses that often can’t afford to offer workplace insurance, she said. The most obvious category of people who don’t have workplace insurance are those who don’t have a job. This group includes children and retirees, people searching for work, people who choose not to work, and those who can’t work, because of a disability or illness. Another group without employer-provided insurance is the 25% of people ages 18 to 64 who have a job but are unable to obtainsuch insurance, according to2023 data from KFF. Some of these people work for companies that don’t offer health insurance. These employers tend to be small businesses or part of certain industries, such as farming and construction. Others are part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers at companies that offer health insurance only to full-time employees. Workers with low incomes are significantly less likely than those with higher incomes to be eligible for workplace insurance,according to 2023 KFF data. People who aren’t employed or don’t get insurance through their job can get coverage in other ways. Some are insured through a relative’s workplace plan, while others purchase plans and may qualify for subsidies on the ACA marketplace. Others get insurance through Medicaid or Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 or older and some people with disabilities. Just because someone has health insurance doesn’t mean they’ll get the health care they need. People may skip or delay care if their plans are unaffordable or if they limit in-network providers. ""Health benefits come in all shapes and sizes,"" Fronstin said. ""Some employers offer very generous benefits, and others less so."" KFF data shows that premiums and enrollees’ cost-sharing expenses grew faster than wagesfrom 2008 to 2018but haveslowed in recent years. Whether workplace insurance is affordable significantly varies by income.According to 2020 KFF data, lower-income families insured through a full-time worker spent, on average, 10.4% of their income on premiums and out-of-pocket costs . That’s more than twice the rate when looking at families across all incomes. Thune said, ""A lot of times, health care comes with a job."" This statement is partially accurate. Most workers in the U.S. get health coverage through work. But it glosses over aspects of our nation’s job-based health insurance system — such as how costs and coverage, especially for those with lower incomes, can make an employer plan out of reach even if it is available. Bottom line: Not all jobs provide health insurance or offer plans to all their workers. When they do, cost and quality vary widely — making Thune’s statement an oversimplification.

138,Josh Schoemann,"“The state of Illinois has a lower income tax rate than we do, and a flat tax. It’s almost half of what the top bracket here in Wisconsin is.”",mostly-true,"June 2, 2025",Radio interview,"While Wisconsin’s 2026 race for governor is getting a slow start as Democratic Gov. Tony Eversmulls whether to seek a third term, at least one Republican candidate is off and running. That’s Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, wholaunched his campaign in early Maywith a focus on keeping young people and retirees in Wisconsin, instead of losing them to other states. Schoemann hit on that theme during a June 2, 2025, appearance on conservative radio hostVicki McKenna’s show. ""The state of Illinois has a lower income tax rate than we do, and a flat tax,"" Schoemann said. ""It’s almost half of what the top bracket here in Wisconsin is."" Income taxes are likely to stay a big topic in the race for governor. Republicans in the state Legislature arepushing for a tax exemptionon some retirement income. Conservatives have also criticized Evers forvetoing previous tax relief proposals. PolitiFact Wisconsin found this claim interesting. Does the state just south of us have lower income taxes, theoretically an incentive for Wisconsinites to move there? Let’s check it out. We reached out to Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for Schoemann’s campaign, who pointed us directly to the different rates in Illinois and Wisconsin. Both states’ Departments of Revenue have simple tables showing the individual income tax rates, so we’ll recap those here. InIllinois, the individual income tax equals 4.95% of net income. That rate has been in place since July 1, 2017. InWisconsin, individual income tax rates range from 3.5% to 7.65%, depending on marital status and income. Here’s a breakdown of those brackets for single filers: Clearly, it’s not true that each Wisconsin bracket is lower than Illinois’ blanket 4.95% rate. The two lowest tiers in Wisconsin are actually less. Butmany Wisconsinites fall within that third category, which is 0.35 percentage points higher than Illinois. ""If you make more than $28,640 as a single person or $38,190 as a married couple, you pay more in state income taxes in Wisconsin than in Illinois,"" Voelkel said. There’s still the second part of Schoemann’s claim, that Illinois’ rate is almost half of the top bracket in Wisconsin. Illinois’ rate of 4.95% isn’t quite half of Wisconsin's top rate of 7.65%. If doubled, that would be a 9.9% rate in Wisconsin. But Schoemann did say ""almost."" Let’s give a little more context about flat taxes, since that debate has occurred in previous campaigns for governor in Wisconsin. A progressive tax applies different rates to different incomes, requiring people making more money to pay a larger share of their income than people making less. That’s the system Wisconsin uses. In comparison, a flat tax applies the same rate to everyone. That’s what Illinois uses. According to theTax Foundation, 27 states use progressive taxes, while 14 states have a flat tax. In addition to Illinois, Midwestern states with a flat tax include Iowa, Michigan and Indiana. In a separate appearance on conservative radio hostJay Weber’s showon May 5, 2025, Schoemann said of Wisconsin’s income tax: ""I believe we got to flatten it, on a trajectory to eliminating it, eventually."" Nine states don’t have state income taxes, including Florida, a popular destination for Wisconsin snowbirds. Flat taxes were a discussion in the last race for governor in 2022 — Republican candidate Tim Michelssaid he was open to itand suggested a figure just below 5%. In early 2023, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu pitched a 3.25% flat tax, but theproposal never made itto Evers. Fast forward to 2025, and state lawmakers are now considering more tweaks to the progressive tiers as part of the budget process. Republicansproposedexpanding the second-lowest bracket, applying the 4.4% rate to single filers making up to $50,480. Evers, meanwhile,suggestedcreating a new bracket with a 9.8% rate for single filers earning $500,000 or more or married couples making $1 million or more. Schoemann said ""the state of Illinois has a lower income tax rate than we do, and a flat tax."" And, he added, ""it’s almost half of what the top bracket here in Wisconsin is."" Schoemann clearly understands that Illinois has a flat tax of 4.95%, while Wisconsin has several tiers. The bottom two brackets in Wisconsin are actually lower. And 4.95% isn’t quite half of the top bracket here, which is 7.65%, but Schoemann did hedge his claim with ""almost."" Still, a large swath of filers in Wisconsin certainly see higher income taxes than their counterparts in Illinois. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

167,Kathy Hochul,The state budget contains the largest middle class tax cut in 70 years.,false,"May 5, 2025",television interview,"Gov. Kathy Hochul has claimed for months that her budget delivers to the middle class the largest tax cut in decades. During a rollout for the State of the State in February, Hochul held a conversation with mothers and said: ""We also talked about a middle class tax cut, the largest in 70 years."" On May 2, she saidin Albanythat the state budget for 2025-26 contains ""the largest middle class tax cut in over 70 years, the largest tax cut."" Three days later, aCNNanchor asked Hochul about the spending plan, and Hochul said that it contains ""the biggest tax cut we’ve had for the middle class in 70 years. It’s all about putting money back in their pockets."" The sameday, she made the claim again when she visited Long Island to talk about the budget, saying that it contained ""the largest middle class tax rate decrease in 70 years."" We started looking into her claim in April, when we heardHochul make it on Bloomberg TV. The Department of Budget told us that she meant to say something different. She meant to say that personal income taxes would be at their lowest rate in 70 years for the middle class. Agency spokesman Tim Ruffinen pointed to rates for married couples filing jointly who earn between $161,550 and $323,000. In the enacted budget, the rate will go from6% today(which is amarginal rate) to 5.9% in the2026 tax year, and 5.8% in the 2027 tax year. For families earning less, married joint filers earning between $28,000 and $161,550, the rate will go from 5.5% today to 5.3% by the 2027 tax year. These rates decrease by .1 percentage points per year. These would be the lowest rates since 1959, Ruffinen told us. There is no standard definition for ""middle class,"" and the state has wide income diversity across regions. The median household income in New York State is $84,578, according toCensus data. The median household income in Erie County is $71,175. In New York City it’s $79,713. And in Westchester County, it’s $118,411. While misstating a fact during a press appearance can be understandable, Hochul has repeatedly made the same claim that her budget contains the largest middle class tax rate decrease in 70 years. But the income tax decrease in the 2025-26 budget, adopted on April 29, isn’t the largest in 70 years. The income tax rate applied to the excess of a certain threshold, known as a marginal rate, has fallen for middle-income New Yorkers by more than .1 percentage point in other years. In 1995, under then-Gov. George Pataki, marginal tax rates fell for the middle class by at least .5 percentage points, once the cuts were fully phased in in 1997. For a married couple filing jointly with two dependents earning $75,000, the effectiverate went from4.98% in 1994 to 4.11% in 1997, an average drop of .29 percentage points per year. For a married couple earning $100,000, the rate went from 5.36% in 1994 to 4.5% in 1997, an average drop of .29 percentage points per year. In 2012,the rate went downfor middle-class taxpayers by 1.2 percentage points, depending on how middle-class is defined. Filers in adjacent tax brackets had decreases of .4 percentage points or 2.12 percentage points. Income tax rates fell by more than .1 percentage points in 2023 for some middle income filers. Experts warn of the pitfalls of comparing tax rates over 70 years. The definition of taxable income and the available tax credits and standard deductions has changed. What’s more, income brackets used today to differentiate personal income tax rates are not the same as those used 70 years ago. In 1995, brackets were widened. In 1958, the state canceled income taxes under unusual circumstances. ""Beyond that anomaly, the tax structure and economic conditions of the 1950s, 1960s, or even early 2000s are dramatically different from today’s landscape,"" saidLucy Dadayan,a principal research associate at the Urban Institute who has studied state finances in New York. Differences in the economy and the middle class complicate comparisons from 70 years ago, as well as the fact that tax brackets have not been adjusted for inflation, Dadayan said. One long-time observer of state tax policy questioned the impact of the tax rate decrease. ""At the current inflation rate of 2.8%, the real savings from such a cut will be erased within two years,"" said E.J. McMahon, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. That’s because the budget does not index brackets or standard deductions or exemptions to reflect inflation, which the federal tax code has done for 40 years, he said. As far the claim that Hochul’s staff said she meant to make – that middle class tax rates would be at their lowest level in 70 years –  PolitiFact ruled on a similar claim in 2016 when Gov. Andrew Cuomo made it. We found his claimMostly True. The middle-class rates contained in the new budget are lower than they were in 2016. Hochul has repeated that the state budget contains the largest middle class tax decrease in 70 years. Personal income taxes are not falling by the largest amount in 70 years, they fell more in other years, such as 1995 and 2012.

169,Brenden Jones,“Contractors are being rejected” from providing Hurricane Helene relief in North Carolina because of racial “quotas” required by the state.,false,"April 2, 2025",speech,"A North Carolina legislator said the state’s minority-owned businesses guidelines are hindering its ability to hire contractors to help with Hurricane Helene damage cleanup. State House Majority leader Rep. Brenden Jones, R-Columbus, made the statement April 2 after he was asked about abillhe introduced to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state and local governments. The billpassed 69-45, April 30 along party lines, with Republicans in favor. But before it did, Minority Leader Robert Reives, D-Chatham, asked Jones in a House committee meeting about the bill’s title, ""Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI."" Here’s a transcript of their exchange. Reives: ""I see that (bill title) as an implication that right now there is not equality in hiring in state agencies. Was that a problem that was brought to your attention? And if so, by who?"" Jones: ""Yes, and by several different people."" Reives: ""Were those people who were saying that they were being forced to hire by quotas, or something of that sort?"" Jones: ""Yes, sir."" Reives: ""What statute is … the quota requirement that you're referring to? I haven't seen it, but, you know, I haven't read the law. So there is a quota requirement, you say?"" Jones then cited a state law —GS 143-128.2— which says: ""The state shall have a verifiable 10% goal for participation by minority businesses in the total value of work for each State building project, including building projects done by a private entity on a facility to be leased or purchased by the state."" Jones then said he believes the statute meets thedefinitionof a quota, adding that his push to eliminate it ""stemmed from some of the hurricane disaster relief work that's being done and that contractors are being rejected because they cannot meet some of these so called quotas."" PolitiFact North Carolina reached out to Jones by email and telephone asking him to provide evidence that contractors were turned away from disaster relief work because of the state statute in question. Jones’s office didn’t respond to the questions. We also reached out to the offices of House Speaker Destin Hall and the chairmen of the House Select Committee on Helene Recovery — Republican state Reps. John Bell of Wayne County and Dudley Greene of McDowell County — asking if they’re aware of any contractors who had been barred from working on disaster relief because of state law. Their offices didn’t respond. We also reached out to the Governor's Recovery Office for Western North Carolina, which Gov. Josh Stein created this year to help manage relief efforts for Hurricane Helene. Stein spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said the office is not aware of any contractors being turned away from helping because of the statute Jones cited. The state Department of Administration said Jones’s claims are inaccurate. The state law in question references a ""goal"" of 10% participation in state contracts by minority-owned businesses, and the state considers that to be purely a goal — not a quota, said department spokesperson Julia Hegele. ""There are no required quotas for including minority-owned businesses on state contracts,"" Hegele said. North Carolina’s population is 70% white and 22% Black or multiracial, and 11% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, according to2024 U.S. Census estimates. ""The statute includes a 10% goal (not a quota) for including Historically Underutilized Businesses as subcontractors on government-related construction projects but failure to meet the goal does not prevent a bidder from winning the contract,"" she said. ""The law requires contractors to demonstrate good faith efforts to include HUBs as subcontractors. Under the law, failure to demonstrate making a good faith effort can result in a vendor being disqualified from the bid."" Further, Hegele said the Department of Administration isn’t aware of any contractors being rejected from recovery work because of the statute in question. Jones said ""contractors are being rejected because they can not meet some of these so-called quotas."" He provided no evidence to back up his claim that racial quotas exist at all, or that they’re responsible for a slowdown in disaster response.

182,Karoline Leavitt,President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill “does not add to the deficit.”,false,"May 19, 2025",White House press briefing,"As House Republicans continued their efforts to advance what President Donald Trump calls his ""big, beautiful bill"" of tax and spending cuts, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt played down the bill’s expected federal deficit impact. At a May 19press briefing, a reporter asked Leavitt, ""Is the president OK with this bill adding to the deficit?"" Leavitt disagreed with the question’s premise. ""This bill does not add to the deficit,"" she said. ""In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisors, this bill will save $1.6 trillion. … There's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill. That's the largest savings for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history."" A deficit is the annual amount by which spending exceeds revenues; the accumulation of all past annual deficits, minus any annual surpluses, is called the federal debt. The bill is still being negotiated, so its potential deficit impact is a moving target. However, numerous independent analyses agree that the bill is on track to add significantly to the federal deficit. That’s because the bill’s tax cuts would reduce incoming federal revenue by more than it restricts spending. Leavitt’s ""$1.6 trillion worth of savings"" appears to refer only to the bill’s proposed spending cuts  without factoring in the lost tax revenue that will increase the annual deficit and the federal government’s cumulative debt, experts said. ""Bottom line — because that is what matters — is that simple math of all the additions and subtractions equals nearly $3 trillion in additional debt"" during the standard budget time frame of 10 years, said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that tracks the federal budget. The White House did not respond to inquiries for this article. The reconciliation bill, as it is called, must pass the House and the Senate in identical form by simple majorities, then be signed by the president. So the measure’s provisions are subject to change, making any point-in-time analysis somewhat uncertain. That said, no expert assessment has shown that the bill will add nothing to the deficit. Congress’ official scorekeepers — the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Officeand the bipartisanJoint Committee on Taxation— have analyzed parts of the bills but have not produced a unified figure for its deficit effect. But, building on CBO and JCT’s work, multiple organizations have compiled assessments of the bill’s potential deficit impact. These assessments show increased deficits from $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next 10 years. ThePenn-Wharton Budget Modelat the University of Pennsylvania estimates that annual deficits will cumulatively increase by about $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years. TheCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think tank that’s hawkish on fiscal policy, has estimated that the bill will add about $3.3 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years, increasing the cumulative federal debt to a record 125% of gross domestic product. The group says the added deficits would reach $5.2 trillion if certain temporary provisions in the bill are made permanent, such as an enhanced child tax credit and an end to taxes on tips and overtime. The ratings agencyMoody’srecently calculated the fiscal impact of extending Trump’s 2017 tax bill, which accounts for much of the reconciliation legislation. Moody’s projected that an extension would add around $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, not counting interest payments. The agency said the deficit increase was a factor in its decision tolower the United States’ credit ratingearlier this month. As for the $1.6 trillion in savings that Leavitt cited in the press briefing, experts said this figure aligns with the bill’s proposed spending cuts. But pointing to the spending cuts without acknowledging the bill’s other effects presents a partial picture, said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank. The $1.6 trillion in savings ""excludes the items that increase the deficit — $3.8 trillion from the tax package, $144 billion for military spending, and another $177 billion for homeland security and other changes,"" Watson said. Leavitt said Trump’s tax and spending bill ""does not add to the deficit."" Analyses of the bill and its deficit impact are based on legislation that is still under negotiation and is changing. But using preliminary information from the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, multiple outside groups’ analyses project that the bill would increase deficits by $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next decade.

186,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"It’s “all true” that the measles vaccine wanes quickly, was never fully safety tested and contains fetal debris.",false,"May 14, 2025",Senate testimony,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comments about the measles vaccine briefly took center stage during his May 14 Senate testimony. Kennedy appeared before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to discuss Health and Human Services’ 2026 budget, and senators questioned him about the 2025 measles outbreak that has killed three people, includingtwo children. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned Kennedy’s statements about the measles vaccine. ""You have consistently been undermining the measles vaccine,"" Murphy said. ""You told the public that the vaccine wanes very quickly. You went on the ‘Dr. Phil’ show and said that the measles vaccine was never fully tested for safety. You said there’s fetal debris in the measles vaccine."" Kennedy answered, ""All true. All true.""  Murphy tried to point to Kennedy’s remarks from his testimony earlier the same day, but Kennedy interrupted: Murphy: ""This morning, in front of — "" Kennedy: ""Do you want me to lie to the public?"" Murphy: ""That’s not — None of that is true."" Kennedy: ""Of course it’s true."" Before becoming the nation’s top public health official, Kennedy notched two decades of work as a leaderin the antivaccine movement. Kennedy’s inaccurate statements mischaracterize how the measles vaccine is made, how it was tested and how it works. Infectious disease and vaccine experts told PolitiFact that the two-dose MMR vaccine provides lifelong protection; that scientists safety tested it before it was approved for use; and that it does not contain human fetal cells or whole fetal DNA. We contacted HHS and received no response. In early April, Kennedytold CBS Newsthat measles persists because the vaccine’s effectiveness decreases fast. ""We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, because the vaccine wanes very quickly,"" he said. That’sinaccurate, vaccine experts said. The measles vaccine is part of a combination vaccine known as the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or theMMR vaccine. It also can include the varicella vaccine, called the MMRV vaccine. Two infectious disease doctors and a vaccinology professor told PolitiFact that when people receive the measles vaccine’srecommended two doses, it provides strong, long-lasting protection against measles infection. ""You will have about a 97% chance of being protected and that protection will extend lifelong,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. That matches what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy oversees —saysabout the measles vaccine’s efficacy. The MMR’s measles vaccine ""provides one of our most remarkably durable and long-lasting protective vaccine-induced antibodies,"" said Patsy Stinchfield, a retired pediatric nurse practitioner and the immediate past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said measles immunity doesn’t wane because measles is a long-incubation period disease, which means it can takeup to 21 daysto develop symptoms after exposure. Measles antibodies might decrease over time, but that doesn’t mean a person’s vaccine-induced protection against measles infection is waning, experts said. To be protected against disease, ""all you need is immunological memory cells,"" Offit said. When you’re exposed to the virus, there’s plenty of time for those memory cells to become activated and trigger the immune system to make measles antibodies, he said. For other diseases covered by the MMR vaccine, the protection can wane over time, said Paulo Verardi, a University of Connecticut virology and vaccinology professor. That’s true of mumps immunity, for example, so people who got vaccinated as children might be less protected from infection as adults, he said. But the measles vaccine doesn’t have that issue, he said. ""It is rare for someone who has been vaccinated to get measles, and if they do, it is usually a mild case,"" Verardi said. ""Most outbreaks happen not because the vaccine wears off quickly, but because not enough people are vaccinated."" During a town hall hosted by TV personality Phil McGraw, known as Dr. Phil, Kennedysaid, ""The measles vaccine works,"" and said HHS recommends vaccination against measles. But there are ""problems"" with the vaccine, Kennedy added. ""The problem is — it’s really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination — and it was never safety tested,"" hesaid. ""That combination was never safety tested, and people just assumed that, you know, if the three separate vaccines were safe, then when you combined them they would be safe. But we now know there’s some viral interference."" Varardi said U.S. regulators approved the first combined MMR vaccine in 1971 ""after extensive clinicaltestingto make sure it was safe and worked well."" Kennedy also often talks about testing vaccines against placebos — inactive substances that provide no protection against disease — and HHS recently announcedpotential changesto vaccine testing that would require placebo testing. When the MMR vaccine was combined, research had shown that each of the components was safe and effective individually, and it isn’t alwaysethicalto test them against placebos that would leave test subjectsunprotectedfrom infection, Offit said. Fortunately, Offit said, we have ""about 50 years of data"" on the billions of doses of the MMR vaccine that have been administered. Schaffner said scientists continue to monitor the MMR vaccine’s safety. Ongoing vaccine safety surveillance is important to catch extremely rare side effects. A Finland MMR vaccine study found that5.3 in every 100,000 peoplevaccinated experienced serious adverse reactions. A2021 studyfound that among 12,032 vaccinated people, four people reported serious vaccine-related events. During an April 30 News Nation interview, Kennedysaidsome people ""have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it."" The MMR vaccine containsweakenedlive viruses, and viruses must begrown in cells. The measles and mumps viruses are grown in chicken embryo cells and the rubella virus is grown in humanfetal cells, which first came from an elective abortion performed in the early 1960s and have beenreplicated in labsand used to manufacture vaccines for decades. Before it becomes a vaccine component, the virus is extracted from the cells where it is grown and then it isweakenedand treated with an enzyme that fragments any remaining DNA, Offit said. So, does the MMR vaccine contain ""fetal debris,"" fetal cells or whole fetal DNA? No, said Offit and Varardi. Whatever DNA is present from the original cell line used to grow the virus likely could be measured in picograms, ""meaning trillionths of a gram,"" Offit said. The origin of the cells used to grow the virus has historically sparked religious concerns. Religious leaders including the Catholic Pontifical Academy for Life concluded that it is both morally permissible and responsible to use the vaccine, the Catholic News Agencyreported. Kennedy told Murphy that it’s ""all true"" that the measles vaccine wanes quickly, was never fully tested for safety and contains fetal debris. Scientists say the measles vaccine offers lifelong protection that is 97% effective at preventing the virus. Scientists tested the MMR vaccine before it was approved for use and perform ongoing safety surveillance research; studies show that serious adverse effects are rare. Finally, the MMR vaccine may contain trace amounts of fragmented DNA, but it does not contain whole fetal cells or fetal DNA. We rate Kennedy’s statement False.

191,Marcia Morey,“Google caved in to Trump. They erased Black History Month from the calendar.”,barely-true,"April 30, 2025",speech in the North Carolina House of Representatives,"A North Carolina legislator says President Donald Trump is the reason why one of the world’s largest corporations decided to scrap a Black History Month recognition on its widely used calendar app. The claim by state Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham, came on the House floor as members debated a bill that aims to rid state agencies of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Republican state Rep. Brenden Jones, the bill’s sponsor, said state governments and corporations across the nation were scrapping DEI initiatives. Responding to Jones, Morey said those states and businesses were capitulating to Trump amid a shift in culture. ""Google caved-in to Trump,"" she said. ""They erased Black History Month from the calendar."" Is that right? Although Black History Month is no longer marked on Google Calendar, there appears to be no direct link between that change and Trump’s administration. In early February, Google announced that it was abandoning its goals of hiring more people from underrepresented groups,citingTrump administration orders that federal government contractors abandon DEI policies. Also in February,mediaoutletsreportedthat Black History Month, Indigenous Peoples Month, Pride Month and certain holidays no longer showed up on Google Calendar, an online app that allows users to manage their schedules, appointments, and events. But in aFeb. 12 statementabout changes to Google Calendar, the company didn’t mention Trump or the federal government. It said Google made its decision to ""simplify"" the calendar in the middle of 2024 as requests mounted for more holiday recognitions. ""Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of moments in a wide number of countries around the world — things like cultural celebrations, teachers days and many more,"" Google’s statement said. The statement continued: ""We got feedback that many other events and countries were missing, and it just wasn’t feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars — so in mid-2024 we made the decision to simplify and show only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com. Contrary to some of the comments on social media, this was not something we did just this year."" The company said it continues to recognize Black History Month inother ways, such as by promoting Black creators on YouTube. The company has made other changes directly responding to Trump's directives, however. After Trump issued anexecutive orderrenaming the area known as the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America,""Google updatedits Maps app to reflect the change. The Google Calendar decision occurred during the 2024 election, as Trump campaigned against diversity policies — promising to target them using executive powers, which he hassince done. By the time media outlets reported on the Google change in February, Trump had become president and had issued anexecutive orderto the federal government to cancel DEI policies. Trump’s order didn’t mention Black History Month, but the Defense Intelligence Agency responded to Trump’s action by ordering a pause of all activities and events related to Black History Month and other ""special observances"" to comply with Trump's executive order,NBC News reported. A Google spokesperson didn’t answer our questions about whether its decision was influenced by Trump’s campaign rhetoric; instead she referred us back to thestatementfrom February. When we asked Morey if she had evidence that Trump pressured Google to remove Black History Month from its calendar, she said her comments about Google caving were more about the influence of anti-DEI culture Trump promotes. ""Every one of the actions we take as a legislature exist within a context,"" Morey said. ""Trump did not pressure any company to do anything, but as I said, they are trying to ‘follow what [Trump] has done and the culture shift he is a part of."" She added: ""In my opinion, if Google did cave to political pressure from Trump, I doubt they would freely tell reporters that."" PolitiFact NC found no evidence that Trump pressured Google about recognizing Black History Monday on its calendar, specifically. We reached out to the White House and asked if Trump had called on Google to remove the holiday from its calendar app. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. But Trump didn’t remove the holiday from his own calendar. In February, the president ended speculation about his position on the celebration by signing aproclamationrecognizing Black History Month andhosting a White House celebration. Morey said ""Google caved in to Trump. They erased Black History Month from the calendar."" Google removed Black History Month and several other holidays from its calendar app, but it did not cite Trump’s influence as a contributing factor. It said it made the decision in the middle of 2024 with the aim of simplifying the app as it managed requests for ""hundreds"" of holidays. It’s possible that Trump’s campaign rhetoric about diversity policies played an indirect role in Google’s decision but Google, which has referenced the administration’s policies for other decisions it has made, did not say so. And Morey produced no evidence that Trump specifically pressured the company about its calendar’s holidays.

214,Brian Tyler Cohen,Trump “just denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene.”,half-true,"April 12, 2025",X post,"A widely-shared social media post lacks important context about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s recent decision about disaster relief in North Carolina. President Donald Trump ""just denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene, calling it ‘unwarranted,’"" liberal pundit Brian Tyler Cohen said in an April 12X post. The post — which reached 6.6 million X accounts, according to the company’s metrics — could give people the impression that North Carolina has been left to deal with Helene relief on its own. That’s not the case. In a follow-upX post, Cohen linked to anews articlethat provided more context. Cohen didn’t respond to a request for comment. Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27 and is the most devastating storm in state history, killing more than 100 people and causing an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to state officials. FEMA initially agreed to pay for 100% of debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 180 days, or until March 27. A week prior to that expiration date, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who was elected to the office in November, wrote a letter to Trump asking him to extend the agreement. ""This extension is critical to make Western North Carolina whole and is in alignment with executive actions from previous storms like Hurricane Maria in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, Hurricane Ike in Texas, and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi,"" Stein wrote. In an April 11response, a top FEMA administrator informed Stein that his request had been denied, saying 100% federal coverage was ""not warranted."" The letter didn’t explain its decision. In a statement to PolitiFact NC, FEMA’s press office said that the agency normally covers 75% of the cost — but will continue paying for 90% of debris removal. ""FEMA initially provided a 100% federal cost share to incentivize speedy debris removal operations and recovery,"" FEMA said in an April 16 statement. ""The typical assistance FEMA provides through its Public Assistance Program is 75%, due to the severity of the disaster with Hurricane Helene, FEMA is providing North Carolina 90% far exceeding the normal 75%."" After receiving FEMA’s letter, Stein issued a statement saying he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision and would ""urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days."" Stein’s office told PolitiFact NC that the difference in covering 90% of the costs and 100% of the costs is an estimated $200 million. That’s money that could be used on other Helene-related projects, or saved as legislators strive toslash state spending. North Carolina budget analysts say the state could face abudget deficitnext year due to declining revenues from tax cuts. Cohen claimed on X that Trump ""denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene."" The vague post could give people the inaccurate impression that Trump is withholding all relief from North Carolina. That’s not the case. FEMA, which operates under the Trump administration, denied a request to cover 100% of North Carolina’s costs for debris removal and other emergency protective measures — but will continue covering 90% of costs as those efforts continue. Cohen’s claim is partially accurate — a request for relief was rejected — but leaves out the important detail that FEMA is still funding 90% of relief.

265,Sydney Batch,"North Carolina “always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it.”",barely-true,"February 28, 2025",podcast interview,"A North Carolina legislator’s recent complaint about judicial elections featured an inaccurate claim about their history. State Sen. Sydney Batch, a Wake County Democrat who is the chamber’s minority leader, recently introduced abillto make North Carolina’s judicial elections nonpartisan. North Carolina’s judicial races are receiving extra attention this year because the November election for an open North Carolina Supreme Court seat remains uncertified. Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin is challenging the eligibility of 60,000 voters who cast ballots in his race against Democrat incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who received 734 more votes than Griffin, recounts showed. Batch discussed her bill during a Feb. 28 appearance on aWUNC-FM podcast. In it, she accused her Republican colleagues of politicizing the court. ""In North Carolina, and in its history, we always had nonpartisan judicial races, and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it,"" Batch said. Republican legislators in recent years made formerly nonpartisan judicial races partisan by requiring that candidates’ party affiliations appear next to their names on ballots. But Batch’s description of the court’s longer history is inaccurate. North Carolina first started electing judges after the Civil War, said Michael Crowell, author of a judicial elections historyreportfor the University of North Carolina School of Government. ""It was seen as a one of many democratic reforms,"" Crowell said. ""And those were partisan elections. The idea of nonpartisan elections just didn't cross anybody's mind."" The voting process was different during Reconstruction than it is now, said Gerry Cohen, who wrote most of the state’s election laws during his 32-year tenure in the legislature's bill drafting office. Party operatives wouldprint ballotswith the names of candidates on them, he said. Voters could simply take a ballot from a party operative and place it in the ballot box to vote. ""Back before literacy, the Democratic Party had a symbol and the Republican Party had a symbol,"" Cohen said. North Carolina’s judicial elections were partisan throughout most of the 20th century, when Democrats controlled the state Legislature. However, when Republicans started winning more judicial races in the 1990s, Democrats moved to make the races nonpartisan,WRAL reported. ""Republicans started getting elected to some offices in the ’70s and ’80s, but it didn't trickle down to judges until the ’90s,"" Crowell told PolitiFact NC in an interview. Democrats didn’t publicly point to any judicial election losses as the reason for making the races nonpartisan, Crowell said. But it was understood to be a factor. ""No Democrats said in the mid ’90s, ‘Look, we need to change this, because Republicans are starting to win elections.’ But that was pretty much what was thought to be the case,"" Crowell said. Elections in different levels of the court system became partisan in different years. Superior court races went from partisan to nonpartisan in 1998. District court elections became nonpartisan in 2002. And the Supreme Court and other appellate court races went nonpartisan in 2004. Then, in 2011, Republicans gained control of the state Legislature for the first time in more than a century. Within a few years, they started making judicial races partisan again. Lawmakers added partisan labels to Court of Appeals candidates in 2016, and to Supreme, Superior and district courts in 2018. The change has paid off: Voters had largely split on judicial elections when they were nonpartisan, but after Republicans made the races partisan again, they’ve won almost every statewide judicial election. The GOP now controls large majorities on the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court. Batch’s office declined to comment for this fact check. Crowell offered a disclaimer to those interested in North Carolina's judicial elections history: ""Keep in mind: both parties have changed their position on fundamental issues over the years about the election of judges depending on what they think benefits them in the short run."" Batch said North Carolina ""always had nonpartisan judicial races and when the Republicans took over several years ago they changed it."" Within the past decade, Republican legislators made judicial races partisan. But North Carolina’s longer history shows judgeship elections were partisan for most of the 20th century.

281,Nick LaLota,"“On Feb. 25, I voted yes on a budget resolution that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while cutting some spending elsewhere.""",false,"March 4, 2025",video message to constituents,"On Feb. 25, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., voted in favor of aHouse budget resolutionthat calls for sharp cuts in spending across a vast array of government areas. Medicaid is among the programs that could be at risk — catapulting it to the center of the political debate. President Donald Trump has insistedhe won’t harm Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security benefits, saying his administration is looking to root out fraud.But Democrats have pushed back, saying the sheer size of the proposed cuts will result in harm to the Medicaid program, its enrollees, and medical providers. A KFF tracking pollhas found widespread public support for Medicaid, which suggests efforts to cut the program could face political headwinds. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. LaLota, who represents part of Long Island,posted a videofor his constituents explaining his position: ""I voted yes on a budget resolution that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while cutting some spending elsewhere."" Because much of his video focused on Medicaid, we did too. We found that his statement in this regard was layered with mischaracterizations and inaccuracies. Still, in his video, LaLota advises his constituents to get their information straight from him, saying, ""I’ll always be honest with you."" We asked LaLota’s office for the information he used to back up his statement. The budget resolution makes no cuts to those programs, he wrote in a statement emailed by his communication aide Mary O’Hara. ""Rather, it opens the door to protect Medicaid with common-sense solutions which ensure its availability for those Americans who qualify, including the removal of illegals from the rolls, work requirements for able-bodied adults, and the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse."" Let’s parse what the resolution does say and do, and the changes it could trigger for Medicaid. Budget resolutions are not law, but rather a blueprint that guides lawmakers on budget-related legislation. The House-passed resolution —approved with 217Republicans voting for it and 214 Democrats and one Republican against — is just one part of the budget process. The Senate also has a say, so changes are possible. As written, the resolution seeks broad spending reductions across a range of areas overseen by various committees. It specifically asks the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to submit proposals ""to reduce the deficit by not less than $880,000,000,000 [$880 billion] for the period of fiscal years 2025  through 2034."" It does not say it would protect Medicaid. The word Medicaid is nowhere in the document. It does not prescribe any specific action on the program , such as instituting work requirements for recipients. Lawmakers separately draft legislation to make program adjustments to achieve the spending cut targets. A little background: Medicaid is a state-federal program that provides medical coverage to lower-income residents, as well as payments to nursing homes for caring for seniors and disabled residents. Medicaid and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Programcover more than 79 million people. Medicare is the federal programthat provides health insurance coverage for some disabled people and most people over age 65. More than 68 million people are enrolled. The resolution directs the committee to draft legislative language that would cut spending from areas under its jurisdiction, which include Medicaid and about half of Medicare. Social Security is mainly overseen in the House by the Committee on Ways and Means. The panel also shares jurisdiction over Medicare with Energy and Commerce. Policy expertsand the Congressional Budget Officehave said that, after removing Medicare from consideration, there’s not enough under the committee’s jurisdiction to cut $880 billion without substantially reducing Medicaid spending. (Medicare is generally considered a third rail because its beneficiaries are a powerful voting bloc.) Indeed, of the $8.8 trillion in projected spending under the committee’s purview for the 10-year period, Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion, or 93%. ""Even if the committee eliminated all of non-Medicare and non-Medicaid spending, they would still have to cut Medicaid by well over $700 billion,"" said Alice Burns, an associate director of KFF’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Adding work requirements — most Medicaid recipients already have jobs — would not yield that level of savings andcould increase state costs. Other cuts suggested by Republicans, including capping federal spending per enrollee, reducing federal matching dollars, and eliminating the use of provider taxes, which states use to pay for their share of Medicaid spending,  could force states to cut spending or find new revenue sources. ""Cuts to Medicaid could mean eliminating coverage for children, parents, working adults or those who might need long term care; limiting benefits; or cutting payment rates for health plans or providers. These choices could come at a time when state revenue growth is slowing, and most states face requirements to pass balanced budgets,"" according to an analysis written by Robin Rudowitz, vice president of the KFF Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The downstream effects if the House-passed budget resolution were enacted would be wide-ranging and significantly alter the safety net program , said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. He noted growing opposition to such large-scale Medicaid cuts from ""beneficiaries and parents of children with disabilities, families with parents in nursing homes, and from health care providers."" ""Medicaid cuts are highly unpopular even among Trump voters,"" he said. Opposition to Medicaid cuts helped kill the 2017 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration, noted Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. Antos thinks the current spending cut target is unrealistic and will likely not survive the effort to merge the House budget blueprint with what the Senate wishes to do. ""Ultimately, the problem is you can’t take that much out of Medicaid,"" Antos said. LaLota’s focus on immigrants lacking legal statusas a way to reduce federal spending on Medicaid is also misleading. A number of states, including New York, offer coverage to children or adults regardless of immigration status, but they can use only state money to pay for such programs. ""States cannot use federal funding to cover undocumented immigrants,"" Burns said. So removing them ""won’t do anything for the deficit reduction targets."" LaLota said, ""On Feb. 25, I voted yes on a budget resolution that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while cutting some spending elsewhere."" His statement is inaccurate and mischaracterizes laws and the language included in the budget resolution, creating a false impression of what his vote supported. The 32-word sentence that directs the Energy and Commerce Committee to trim $880 billion over 10 years from programs it authorizes does not include any protections, guardrails, or specific directions for the panel to follow.

293,Ro Khanna,“Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts.”,half-true,"February 20, 2025",TikTok video,"U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.,posted a TikTok videoFeb. 20 saying he had ""breaking news"" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes. ""Breaking news: The Trump Administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1,"" Khanna said. ""We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."" The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posteda documentonline titled ""Telehealth"" that said, ""Through March 31, 2025, you can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most telehealth services."" CMS did not respond to requests for comment about the post. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment. The telehealth benefit was first put in place as a temporary Trump-era addition to Medicare coverage during the covid-19 public health emergency. Khanna’s statement took on more significance leading up to the threat of a government shutdown, but late last week Congress averted one by approving a stopgap spending bill. The expiration date for the benefit has been known since December, when Congress extended coverage around telehealth through March 31. The roughly 90-day reprieve was part of a compromise after then-President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk criticized a sweeping, end-of-year legislative package that would have, among other things, continued those benefits for two years. Their opposition forced Congress to pass a stripped-down version of the end-of-year bill. Telehealth’s two-year extension, included in the initial bill, became collateral damage. Last week, just as the clock was ticking down, House Republicans passed aspending billfor the rest of the fiscal year that includes another extension of telehealth flexibilities — this one lasting through September. The Senate then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature, with the support of 10 Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Regardless, the two-year extension proposed in December — or a permanent extension, as Khanna has urged — looks unlikely. ""President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years,"" Khanna told us via email. ""Trump should work with Congress to extend telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries."" It wouldn’t come free. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. The CBO calculated five months of expanded telehealth coverage as costing $663 million, and calculated that that would total almost $25 billion through fiscal year 2031 if spending remained level, which it may not do. Also, the agency and the Government Accountability Office have raised concerns about fraud and overuse of the benefit, among other potential issues. Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but leftother telehealth benefitshanging on by a string. Instead, lawmakers extended them for short periods during the nearly two years since the public health emergency officially ended in May 2023. ""Now, once again, we’ve got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away,"" said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association. And if, at some point, the telehealth benefits aren’t extended, is it fair to describe the policy change as a cut? Khanna, for instance, plans to introduce the Telehealth Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to cover seniors' telehealth services. Politically speaking, it’s a powerful question when trying to leverage public support — and politicians in both parties often accuse their opponents of ""cutting"" federal benefits when they make changes to programs. ""Khanna is overly dramatic,"" said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. If the provision expires, Antos said, ""this is not a Trump cut."" But beneficiaries might have a different experience. Since the early days of the pandemic — five years now —millions of patientshave come to rely on telehealth for their medical services. That benefit, even with another temporary reprieve, would still be at risk. According to CMS, more than 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries used virtual care services as of 2023. And, after the Trump administration green-lighted telehealth for Medicare recipients in 2020, many private insurers did the same. Overall telehealth claims rose from fewer than 1% of all commercial claims before the covid pandemic to a peak of 13% in April 2020. Now they stand at close to 5%, according to Fair Health, a nonprofit that tracks health care costs. Those in the telehealth industry are optimistic about the current extension. The Trump administration, they say, has been sending encouraging signals — even highlighting its previous support of telemedicine in its fact sheet on the launch of the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission. ""We’ve been sweating bullets,"" Zebley said. ""But it’s been nerve-wracking before. I think we’re going to get it done."" Antos said, however, that after the extension in the House-passed spending bill, Medicare’s telemedicine benefits could be dead. Khanna said, ""Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."" The statement is partially accurate, because the Trump administration announced the March 31 sunset of Medicare telehealth visits, and some beneficiaries who were using that benefit could see it as a ""cut."" But the claim lacks key context that the expiration date was set by Congress, not the Trump administration. After Khanna’s claim, Congress extended access to telehealth coverage through September.

It also ignores the multiple public health departments and officials, including new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. that have spoken about the outbreak. (Screenshot from Threads) The account that shared the Threads post has alsopostednumerous anti-vaccine posts and others that falsely claim viruses don’t exist. The Texas Department of State Health Services has issuednews releasesand public health alerts since Jan. 23, when itannouncedthat two people in Houston’s Harris County who had traveled internationally were the first confirmed measles cases in Texas since 2023. Texas health officialssaythose two cases are unrelated to the West Texas outbreak, the bulk of which are in Gaines County. The department on Feb. 26announcedthe outbreak’s first death, a school-aged child who was not vaccinated. Of the 146 Texas measles cases, five were among people vaccinated for measles and the rest among people who were not vaccinated or whose statuses were unknown. The Centers for Disease Controlsaidas of Feb. 27 there were 164 measles cases in nine states — the agency is updating those totals every Friday. State public health department numbers were slightly higher, with 169 confirmed measles cases in nine states: Texas with 146,New Mexicowith nine,California,GeorgiaandNew Jerseywith three each,New York Citywith two, and one each inAlaska,KentuckyandRhode Island. Kennedyspoke about the measles outbreakFeb. 26 to reporters at Trump’s first Cabinet meeting. The CDC said the U.S. has had three measles outbreaks this year and 16 in 2024. Kennedy said. ""It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year."" There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDCdata shows. The Texas child’s death was thefirst in the U.S. since 2015. Statedatashowed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About91% of all U.S. childrenhave been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the viruskilled about 107,500 peopleworldwide in 2023. That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare. USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video onotherwebsites. When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists. Public health and medical websites often usestock photos, olderunidentifiablemedicalphotos, orclip artto illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people.

368,Susan Crawford,Wisconsin does not “require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer.”,true,"February 9, 2025",TV interview,"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, theliberal candidate in the race, was asked byWISN-TV’s ""Upfront""during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. Crawford, as a private attorney,represented Planned Parenthoodin challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. ""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said. Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panelfound the law unconstitutional in 2015. Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas. Let’s start with laying out what theCode of Judicial Conductsays about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer. Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy."" Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion? That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue. ""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders. ""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. But sometimes it’s not quite so straightforward. Schweber sees recusal decisions as a spectrum. At the most obvious end is recusing because you’d make money if you rule a certain way. At the other end is recusing because of a philosophical belief you have. If a justice worked for Planned Parenthood on the particular issue in a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court, recusal would be appropriate, Schweber said. But simply working for Planned Parenthood is less so. ""It’s unfortunately really quite difficult to be much more specific than that, because there’s an element of judgment involved,"" Schweber said. Crawford’s campaign provided much of the same background when PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out, citing areport on recusal from the State Democracy Research Initiativeat UW’s Law School. ""Notably, Judge Crawford’s representation of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was not the same action that is now before the court. Recusal is not required simply for having represented a party in previous actions,"" her campaign said. For context, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin hasasked the Supreme Courtto recognize a constitutional right to bodily autonomy, including abortion. Schweber said working on a particular issue like the constitutionality of Act 10 would be a stronger case for recusal. ""It’s further down that spectrum of possibilities,"" Schweber said. Another way to look at the spectrum: Conservative Justice Brian Hagedornrecusedfrom the current Act 10 case because he helped create the law and defended it as former Gov. Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel. Crawford also addressed Act 10 in the interview — she represented teachers challenging the law. Crawford said she’d consider the parties bringing the lawsuit and which part of Act 10 is being litigated. That gets into a second major idea that supports Crawford’s claim. In Wisconsin, Supreme Court justicesdecide for themselvesif they’d be biased on a certain issue and if they should recuse. The other justices can’t overrule their decision. So, it would be up to Crawford to make the final call about whether to step away from a case involving a group she represented or an issue she worked on in the past. ""If you work for Planned Parenthood, you can assume that you’re not hostile to the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" Geyh said. ""But even then, there is no rule that says once you stop doing that and you put on your judicial hat, that you are somehow compromised in your ability to be fair and impartial,"" he said. Because justices rule on their own bias, some have called for stricter standards. Geyh is on board with that idea but cautioned that partisan interests could ""manufacture"" new rules to get a justice off a case. Crawford and her conservative opponent, Waukesha County Court Judge Brad Schimel, were asked by WISN if they would back imposing recusal rules for the Supreme Court. Schimel said he would want to see what the rules would be before deciding whether to support them. Crawford said she thinks the current judicial code is a ""workable system, but I also welcome any opportunities to strengthen and improve a system like that."" Crawford said Wisconsin does not ""require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer."" Legal experts interviewed by PolitiFact Wisconsin agreed — it would be a slippery slope if justices weren’t allowed to participate in cases that broadly relate to their past work. The judicial code requires recusal if the justice worked as a lawyer in the ""matter in controversy."" That refers to a particular lawsuit, not a broad issue like abortion. But there can be gray areas. Ultimately, it’s up to Crawford to determine whether she’d be impartial in a case, the same as any other justice on the bench.

433,Ron Johnson,We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship.”,mostly-true,"January 26, 2025",TV interview,"In the first days of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, one of the biggest news stories was something that’s existed in Americasince 1868— birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenshiprefers to the constitutional guarantee, laid out in the 14th Amendment, that all children born in the United States is automatically a U.S. citizen, even if their parents are in the country illegally. As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed anexecutive orderaiming to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. if neither their mother or father is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. The order was immediately challenged in court,and a federal judge temporarily blocked it. The Trump administration has promised to appeal. Many Republicans, includingmembers of Congress from Wisconsin, have backed Trump’s position on reinterpreting birthright citizenship. That includes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who discussed the topicJan. 26on WISN-TV’s Sunday morning show""Upfront."" ""We’re one of the very few nations that allowed birthright citizenship,"" Johnson said. ""It’s kind of crazy that this is the policy of the United States."" ""I’m not sure the people passing the 14th Amendment would anticipate wide open borders and this flood of illegal immigrants coming uncontrolled into this country, somewhat incentivized by birthright citizenship,"" he said. Johnson has previously expressed support for ending birthright citizenship, including at aSenate hearing in December. Then, he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that grant it. With so much attention on birthright citizenship, PolitiFact Wisconsin thought Johnson’s claim was interesting. Is the U.S. an outlier in offering automatic citizenship to children born here? Let’s take a look. PolitiFact National checked a similar claimfrom Trump earlier in January, when he falsely said the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. Aboutthree dozen countriesoffer automatic citizenship to people born in the country, without restrictions. Countries with restrictions, for example, might require one parent to be born there or a citizen. We presented the 35 number to Johnson’s office and asked for evidence and context to back up his statement. His spokeswoman, Kiersten Pels, noted that ""35 of 195 (total countries) is only 18 percent of countries."" ""Additionally, Canada and the U.S. are the only two ""developed"" nations (according to IMF) to allow it,"" she said. That refers to theInternational Monetary Fund’s distinctionbetween countries with ""advanced economies,"" such as the U.S. and Canada, versus ""emerging and developing economies."" Other populous countries that provide unrestricted birthright citizenship, but are under the IMF’s ""emerging and developing"" category, include Mexico and Brazil. Interestingly, nearly all countries that offer it are in North America, South America or the Caribbean: Aproduct of colonial times, when immigration was encouraged to populate settlements in the ""New World."" ""The American conception of citizenship is informed by the English common law doctrine ofjus soli (""right of soil""), in which a person’s nationality at birth is determined by the territory where that person is born,"" according to the Cornell Law School’sLegal Information Institute. Some countrieshave recently done away with unrestricted birthright citizenship and added conditions, including Ireland in 2005 and New Zealand in 2006. Johnson said the U.S. is one of a ""very few"" nations with birthright citizenship. Thirty-five nations have it, but ""very few"" is a pretty subjective number when compared to 195 total countries. PolitiFact Wisconsin took that into account when rating the claim. Johnson’s initial claim was True when he said the U.S. is in the ""minority"" of countries that offer it — if 18 percent of countries have it, that’s certainly not a majority. But the U.S. isn’t an anomaly either, at least on this side of the world. Canada and Mexico, two very large countries next to the U.S., both have birthright citizenship. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

464,Roy Cooper,North Carolina Republicans “took money out of western North Carolina” with Hurricane Helene relief bill.,half-true,"December 3, 2024",comments to reporters,"North Carolina legislators in December enacted a storm relief bill that simultaneously reduced legal powers for the offices of the governor and other seats won by Democrats. Thebillbecame law Dec. 11 after the Republican-majority state legislature voted to override then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto. Cooper, a Democrat, had argued the bill strips money from Hurricane Helene victims, who were still rebuilding after the September storm ravaged western Western North Carolina. Before the Legislature voted to override Cooper’s veto, the governor told reporters on Dec. 3 that the bill ""took away the next governor's authority to continue enhanced unemployment payments from people who lost their job because of the storm."" ""So, they actually took money out of western North Carolina,"" he said. Cooper made similar claims on social media later that day. In anX post, Cooper said the bill ""hurts Western North Carolina by stripping away higher unemployment benefits for people who lost jobs from the storm."" The post also included a clip of Cooper speaking on MSNBC, saying Republicans ""actually took money away from western North Carolina."" Does the bill really take money away from western North Carolina? The law ends the governor’s ability to boost unemployment benefits amid a state emergency, something Cooper did after Helene. That could mean that North Carolinians won’t receive higher benefits in the future. But the law doesn’t include a provision that would withdraw any money that has already been allocated to people in the western part of the state. When Cooper made this statement, the bill had not yet become law, so his use of the past tense may have confused some North Carolinians. It’s also worth noting that unemployment aid is far from the only way the state has been helping Helene victims. Beyond the immediate response that included hundreds of state and federal workers on the ground, the Republican-led state legislature has also approved more than $1 billion in Helene aid relief. That’s a fraction of the nearly $4 billion in aid Cooper called for while governor, though state lawmakers say they plan to do more in the future. Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27, bringing 30 inches of rain, causing more than 1,400 landslides. It was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. According to an estimate by the state’s budget director, Helene damaged about 74,000 western North Carolina homes — only about 5% of which were covered by flood insurance. On Oct. 16, Cooper issued anexecutive orderthat raised the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $350 per week to $600 per week and extended eligibility from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for Helene victims. Coopercitedpowers granted to him under the state's Emergency Management Act when announcing the order. The increased amount was available to anyone seeking unemployment benefits in North Carolina — not just Helene victims. Unemployment benefit payouts increased by more than 10,000 cases after Helene hit North Carolina, according to data provided by the state commerce department. In August, 19,271 people received benefits. The number dipped to 17,981 in September, then shot up to 27,385 in October and rose to 31,547 by the end of the year. Republican leaders don’t believe the Emergency Management Act authorizes the governor to boost unemployment benefits, so they included a section inSenate Bill 382to ""correct a misapprehension of the powers conferred to the governor,"" the bill states. It also says the law ""does not allow for the governor to waive, modify, suspend, or fail to enforce or execute"" the laws related to employment security. Cooper’s claim that Republicans ""took"" money out of western North Carolina could give the impression that money going to Helene victims, or that was scheduled to go to Helene victims, is being revoked. But that’s not so. Thebill saysthe enhanced employment security benefits won’t end until March 1, when North Carolina’s state of emergency isscheduled to expire. ""This does not take money from Western North Carolina and does not impact a single dollar of unemployment benefits currently flowing to employees in that area,"" Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact in a statement. Cooper’s office didn’t dispute that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched, but argued that Helene victims will likely still need the enhanced benefits after March 1, so withdrawing the governor’s ability to increase those payments will have significant consequences for people struggling to rebuild. Gov. Josh Stein, also a Democrat, is expected to extend the state of emergency beyond March 1, Cooper’s office said last month, before Stein was sworn in. States of emergency for less-devastating hurricanes lasted longer than six months. For example, North Carolina was under a state of emergency for15 monthsfollowing 2018’s Hurricane Florence. ""Because Republican legislators are shortchanging western North Carolina recovery, especially the small business grants that are desperately needed to support the economy, residents out west will need enhanced unemployment benefits beyond next March,"" Cooper spokesperson Ben Conroy said. ""The Legislature's shameful decision to rip this power away from future governors only harms North Carolinians who need support to recover from this and future natural disasters,"" Conroy said. Laura Brewer, a Stein spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the new governor hasn’t decided whether to extend the state of emergency, adding that there are many options ""to help them rebuild and recover, including support for those who have lost their jobs, homes, and businesses."" Cooper said North Carolina Republicans ""took money out of western North Carolina"" when they passed a Hurricane Helene relief bill last month. Legislators stripped the governor’s power to enhance unemployment benefits using the state’s Emergency Management Act. Cooper has a point in that if the state of emergency is extended without the bill in place, unemployed Helene victims could continue to receive enhanced benefits beyond March 1. But the bill did not claw back or halt enhanced unemployment benefits that are scheduled to be available through March 1.

514,Dana Loesch,Buncombe County “is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.”,half-true,"January 6, 2025",X post,"Some social media users are angry that North Carolina property owners must still pay full taxes on properties that were damaged after Hurricane Helene. The September storm was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. It brought 30 inches of rain, caused more than 1,400 landslides, and damaged about 74,000 homes in western North Carolina — where only about 5% of victims have flood insurance, according to anestimateby the state’s budget director. In a Jan. 6X post, Buncombe County reminded residents to pay their 2024 property taxes before they become delinquent — prompting outrage from some users of the platform. ""This county is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply,"" Dana Loesch, a conservative radio show host, told her 1 million X followers ina post. OtherXusersposted similar responses, suggesting that Buncombe should waive or reduce property taxes for people affected by Helene. A viewer emailed WRAL-TV, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, asking if it’s true that Buncombe County and other counties in North Carolina are collecting taxes on Helene-damaged properties. The county is indeed collecting taxes. But Loesch’s focus on Buncombe makes it seem as though the county is doing something out of line. In fact, Buncombe — and other North Carolina counties that are collecting taxes — are acting in accordance with state law. Although receiving a hefty tax bill may feel like a bitter pill following the disaster of losing one’s property, the reality of the state’s taxation system gives counties little flexibility. Properties are taxed based on what their assessed values were as of Jan. 1 of that year. Buncombe County properties were last assessed in 2021 and those values are still in place. That means the damages from Helene aren’t reflected in the most recent tax bills. And they won’t be reflected until updated assessments are applied. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. State law prevents counties from doing that, so Buncombe officials can’t give Helene victims a break on their 2024 property tax bill — even if they wanted to. There’s an appeals process, but the deadline for that ended before Helene hit. Buncombe County officials are encouraging property owners to tell the county about damage to their properties, so that it can be reflected in the next assessment. Loesch wrote that properties are being taxed on assessments that ""no longer apply."" The property’s value as of Jan. 1 still applies to a property owner’s 2024 tax bill — even if it doesn’t reflect the current market value, or what someone might be willing to pay by the end of the year. Loesch didn’t respond to our questions about her statement. Here’s how the taxing process works: Because properties are taxed based on their assessed value as of Jan. 1, damage from Helene doesn’t factor into the 2024 tax bill. Dia Harris, a North Carolina Department of Revenue spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the agency regularly fields questions from property owners about how disasters might affect their tax bill. ""A property owner whose residence is lost to fire during the calendar year will still be responsible for payment of taxes that are due on the property for that year,"" Harris said. ""And the bill must be based on the full value of the property’s condition as of Jan. 1 of that year."" Why are taxes based on a property’s value as of Jan. 1, as opposed to another date? The Jan. 1 date is set by state law and provides county governments with some insight into the size of their tax base, which is helpful for county leaders as they set the next fiscal year spending plan, said Chris McLaughlin, a professor of public law and government at UNC-Chapel Hill whopostedabout the issue in a Oct. 11 blog entry. If values go down after an assessment, for instance, county leaders might consider raising the tax rate to make up for lost revenue. State legislators ""chose Jan. 1 presumably because it is well in advance of the start of the fiscal year (July 1) for which taxes will be levied,"" McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email. ""This provides the local government with some certainty about the size of its tax base (although there will be minor changes due to appeals) so it can accurately budget and decide upon a property tax rate before the fiscal year begins."" Some social media posts suggested that Buncombe County should waive or postpone property tax bills. However, state law prohibits counties from doing that. Thelaw reads: ""The governing body of a taxing unit is prohibited from releasing, refunding, or compromising all or any portion of the taxes levied against any property within its jurisdiction except as expressly provided in this subchapter."" Unless state legislators change the law, ""local governments may not waive property taxes as a response to a natural disaster,"" McLaughlin said. If Helene victims want immediate property tax relief, he said ""they should talk to their local representatives and tell them to pass a bill."" In the meantime, Buncombe is offering assistance in other ways. The county offerspayment plansto property owners who want to avoid paying their tax bill in one lump sum. The county also offers financialassistance to low-income householdsin areas where increasing property value outpaces income. In advance of the 2025 tax bill, Buncombe officials are asking residents to inform them of any damage sustained to their properties. The county’swebsitefeatures a banner: ""Please report damage to your home or property caused by Hurricane Helene."" Clicking the banner opens aformthat Buncombe residents can fill out online and submit to the county. ""Property that is damaged as of Jan. 1, 2025, will see a reduction in 2025’s taxable value,"" said Kassi Day, a Buncombe County spokesperson. ""Our assessment team has been working hard to survey damaged areas so values can be updated to reflect the current situation."" Buncombe officials are also taking action that could limit the effect of property taxes in 2025. The county was scheduled to conduct a revaluation in 2025 — taking into account how market values have risen over the last four years. Buncombe’s Board of Commissioners recentlyvoted to delaythe county’s reappraisal of properties, allowing the 2025 values to remain based on 2021 market assessments. Loesch said Buncombe County ""is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply."" Buncombe and other counties are collecting taxes on properties even if they were damaged by Helene. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that the damage from Helene is relevant to the 2024 tax bill, which in North Carolina is based on a property’s assessed value as of Jan. 1, 2024 — months before Helene made landfall. Properties that lost value because of damage from Helene could see that reflected on their tax bill due in 2025, Buncombe officials said. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. Generally speaking, state law prevents counties from doing that. Loesch’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that might influence someone’s understanding of the situation.
