People in North Carolina political circles have been keeping tabs on Cooper, looking for signs that he might officially announce his 2026 candidacy for the seat being vacated by Republican U.S. Sen.

The North State Journal, a North Carolina-based newspaper, on July 8 referenced the event in anarticleabout the U.S. Senate race, reporting that it fueled speculation that Cooper would run.

""That's fake,"" said Morgan Jackson, Cooper’s spokesman and longtime political consultant. ""I don't know where that came from.""

The law does aim to improve the quality and efficiency of care. At some level, that would change what doctors do. Physicians are wary of change, and the way the law will work is complex. In contrast, we found many provisions that support an open process geared toward providing better care. Primary care doctors seem most inclined to support the law, as do a large number of physician professional associations. Support for the law is weaker among specialists, who are more likely to question what it means for their compensation and more likely to face scrutiny for using high-cost tests and procedures. But that doesnt mean the government is placing itself between doctors and patients. The law is complex, but it leaves intact the private sector delivery of health care.

They are making it very easy to realize there is no ‘virus.’"" The post shared four images from news reports inUSA Today,NPR,ABC NewsandFox Newsthat used stock images of people stricken with measles, a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can causeserious complications, including arashwith visible flat, red spots on a victim’s body. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) The Threads post’s assertion that stock image usage is evidence that the outbreak isn’t real misunderstands how photojournalism works. It also ignores the multiple public health departments and officials, including new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. that have spoken about the outbreak. (Screenshot from Threads) The account that shared the Threads post has alsopostednumerous anti-vaccine posts and others that falsely claim viruses don’t exist. The Texas Department of State Health Services has issuednews releasesand public health alerts since Jan. 23, when itannouncedthat two people in Houston’s Harris County who had traveled internationally were the first confirmed measles cases in Texas since 2023. Texas health officialssaythose two cases are unrelated to the West Texas outbreak, the bulk of which are in Gaines County. The department on Feb. 26announcedthe outbreak’s first death, a school-aged child who was not vaccinated. Of the 146 Texas measles cases, five were among people vaccinated for measles and the rest among people who were not vaccinated or whose statuses were unknown. The Centers for Disease Controlsaidas of Feb. 27 there were 164 measles cases in nine states — the agency is updating those totals every Friday. State public health department numbers were slightly higher, with 169 confirmed measles cases in nine states: Texas with 146,New Mexicowith nine,California,GeorgiaandNew Jerseywith three each,New York Citywith two, and one each inAlaska,KentuckyandRhode Island. Kennedyspoke about the measles outbreakFeb. 26 to reporters at Trump’s first Cabinet meeting. The CDC said the U.S. has had three measles outbreaks this year and 16 in 2024. Kennedy said. ""It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year."" There were 16 U.S. outbreaks in 2024, with 285 cases across 33 jurisdictions, CDCdata shows. The Texas child’s death was thefirst in the U.S. since 2015. Statedatashowed it came in a county with one of the state’s highest rates of school-aged children who received exemptions from receiving one or more required vaccines for reasons of conscience. About91% of all U.S. childrenhave been vaccinated. The World Health Organization said the viruskilled about 107,500 peopleworldwide in 2023. That the news outlets used stock images showing unidentifiable children with measles is not unusual, particularly when reporting on health issues in which live photos are rare. USA Today, ABC News and NPR all used different stock images provided by Getty Images to illustrate stories about measles. It’s not clear where the Fox News images came from, but we found the two stock images seen in the Fox video onotherwebsites. When patients consent to be identified or photographed, news organizations are more likely to use those images in their coverage. None of the Texas measles victims in Texas have been identified by state officials due to privacy laws. People with measles also would likely be in quarantine at home or being treated in a hospital, not sharing their highly contagious disease with journalists. Public health and medical websites often usestock photos, olderunidentifiablemedicalphotos, orclip artto illustrate stories about various diseases, rather than photos of currently ill people. The claim that the use of these images in stories about a current outbreak proves that the outbreak is not real is nonsensical. We rate it Pants on Fire!"

The German intelligence agency seemed equally unconvinced that Iraq had resumed its nuclear program. For the French, the American assertion that Iraq sought to buy uranium from Africa rang hollow. The alleged source was Niger, a country where the French had contacts in the mining industry. Anytime we deal with the activities of intelligence services, there are likely to be gaps in the public record. They might have had suspicions, but they were uncertain and said so publicly and, in all likelihood, privately as well. Wolfowitz went too far when he said that Germany and France believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. At best they were conflicted."

5371,false,Says Mitt Romney supports cap and trade.,rick santorum,,0.0,7.0,13.0,12.0,0.0,16.0,5.0,a video ad airing in Michigan,"Santorums ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of ""job-killing cap and trade. ""While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said hes opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb.  22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms. ""To Pizer, these carbon limits dont fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe youd call it the same family, but its different because youre telling each source, heres what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs. This idea of trying to limit businesses exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade. ""We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romneys administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade. ""But he added, ""its in the eye of the beholder. ""We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact."

186,false,"It’s “all true” that the measles vaccine wanes quickly, was never fully safety tested and contains fetal debris.",robert f kennedy jr,Unknown,,,,0.0,,,,Senate testimony,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comments about the measles vaccine briefly took center stage during his May 14 Senate testimony. Kennedy appeared before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to discuss Health and Human Services’ 2026 budget, and senators questioned him about the 2025 measles outbreak that has killed three people, includingtwo children. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned Kennedy’s statements about the measles vaccine. ""You have consistently been undermining the measles vaccine,"" Murphy said. ""You told the public that the vaccine wanes very quickly. You went on the ‘Dr. Phil’ show and said that the measles vaccine was never fully tested for safety. You said there’s fetal debris in the measles vaccine."" Kennedy answered, ""All true. All true.""  Murphy tried to point to Kennedy’s remarks from his testimony earlier the same day, but Kennedy interrupted: Murphy: ""This morning, in front of — "" Kennedy: ""Do you want me to lie to the public?"" Murphy: ""That’s not — None of that is true."" Kennedy: ""Of course it’s true."" Before becoming the nation’s top public health official, Kennedy notched two decades of work as a leaderin the antivaccine movement. Kennedy’s inaccurate statements mischaracterize how the measles vaccine is made, how it was tested and how it works. Infectious disease and vaccine experts told PolitiFact that the two-dose MMR vaccine provides lifelong protection; that scientists safety tested it before it was approved for use; and that it does not contain human fetal cells or whole fetal DNA. We contacted HHS and received no response. In early April, Kennedytold CBS Newsthat measles persists because the vaccine’s effectiveness decreases fast. ""We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, because the vaccine wanes very quickly,"" he said. That’sinaccurate, vaccine experts said. The measles vaccine is part of a combination vaccine known as the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or theMMR vaccine. It also can include the varicella vaccine, called the MMRV vaccine. Two infectious disease doctors and a vaccinology professor told PolitiFact that when people receive the measles vaccine’srecommended two doses, it provides strong, long-lasting protection against measles infection. ""You will have about a 97% chance of being protected and that protection will extend lifelong,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. That matches what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy oversees —saysabout the measles vaccine’s efficacy. The MMR’s measles vaccine ""provides one of our most remarkably durable and long-lasting protective vaccine-induced antibodies,"" said Patsy Stinchfield, a retired pediatric nurse practitioner and the immediate past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said measles immunity doesn’t wane because measles is a long-incubation period disease, which means it can takeup to 21 daysto develop symptoms after exposure. Measles antibodies might decrease over time, but that doesn’t mean a person’s vaccine-induced protection against measles infection is waning, experts said. To be protected against disease, ""all you need is immunological memory cells,"" Offit said. When you’re exposed to the virus, there’s plenty of time for those memory cells to become activated and trigger the immune system to make measles antibodies, he said. For other diseases covered by the MMR vaccine, the protection can wane over time, said Paulo Verardi, a University of Connecticut virology and vaccinology professor. That’s true of mumps immunity, for example, so people who got vaccinated as children might be less protected from infection as adults, he said. But the measles vaccine doesn’t have that issue, he said. ""It is rare for someone who has been vaccinated to get measles, and if they do, it is usually a mild case,"" Verardi said. ""Most outbreaks happen not because the vaccine wears off quickly, but because not enough people are vaccinated."" During a town hall hosted by TV personality Phil McGraw, known as Dr. Phil, Kennedysaid, ""The measles vaccine works,"" and said HHS recommends vaccination against measles. But there are ""problems"" with the vaccine, Kennedy added. ""The problem is — it’s really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination — and it was never safety tested,"" hesaid. ""That combination was never safety tested, and people just assumed that, you know, if the three separate vaccines were safe, then when you combined them they would be safe. But we now know there’s some viral interference."" Varardi said U.S. regulators approved the first combined MMR vaccine in 1971 ""after extensive clinicaltestingto make sure it was safe and worked well."" Kennedy also often talks about testing vaccines against placebos — inactive substances that provide no protection against disease — and HHS recently announcedpotential changesto vaccine testing that would require placebo testing. When the MMR vaccine was combined, research had shown that each of the components was safe and effective individually, and it isn’t alwaysethicalto test them against placebos that would leave test subjectsunprotectedfrom infection, Offit said. Fortunately, Offit said, we have ""about 50 years of data"" on the billions of doses of the MMR vaccine that have been administered. Schaffner said scientists continue to monitor the MMR vaccine’s safety. Ongoing vaccine safety surveillance is important to catch extremely rare side effects. A Finland MMR vaccine study found that5.3 in every 100,000 peoplevaccinated experienced serious adverse reactions. A2021 studyfound that among 12,032 vaccinated people, four people reported serious vaccine-related events. During an April 30 News Nation interview, Kennedysaidsome people ""have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it."" The MMR vaccine containsweakenedlive viruses, and viruses must begrown in cells. The measles and mumps viruses are grown in chicken embryo cells and the rubella virus is grown in humanfetal cells, which first came from an elective abortion performed in the early 1960s and have beenreplicated in labsand used to manufacture vaccines for decades. Before it becomes a vaccine component, the virus is extracted from the cells where it is grown and then it isweakenedand treated with an enzyme that fragments any remaining DNA, Offit said. So, does the MMR vaccine contain ""fetal debris,"" fetal cells or whole fetal DNA? No, said Offit and Varardi. Whatever DNA is present from the original cell line used to grow the virus likely could be measured in picograms, ""meaning trillionths of a gram,"" Offit said. The origin of the cells used to grow the virus has historically sparked religious concerns. Religious leaders including the Catholic Pontifical Academy for Life concluded that it is both morally permissible and responsible to use the vaccine, the Catholic News Agencyreported. Kennedy told Murphy that it’s ""all true"" that the measles vaccine wanes quickly, was never fully tested for safety and contains fetal debris. Scientists say the measles vaccine offers lifelong protection that is 97% effective at preventing the virus. Scientists tested the MMR vaccine before it was approved for use and perform ongoing safety surveillance research; studies show that serious adverse effects are rare. Finally, the MMR vaccine may contain trace amounts of fragmented DNA, but it does not contain whole fetal cells or fetal DNA. We rate Kennedy’s statement False.
