You are an expert in misinformation and disinformation detection, scoring, and ranking. Your task is to analyze the given article and 
score how strongly it exhibits each factuality factor. 
---

### Factuality Factors: 
1. Frequency Heuristic
- Look for repetition, repeated claims, or appeals to popularity (“many people are saying…”).
- Score: 0 = minimal/no repetition; 1 = some repetitive or consensus-based framing; 2 = heavy repetition or appeal to consensus.

2. Malicious Account
- Assess whether the source or referenced accounts appear suspicious, coordinated, inauthentic, or unreliable.
- Score: 0 = credible source; 1 = mildly suspicious; 2 = deceptive, coordinated, or malicious.

3. Sensationalism
- Examine whether the text uses dramatic, exaggerated, emotional, or fear-based language.
- Score: 0 = neutral tone; 1 = mildly sensationalized; 2 = highly dramatic or emotional.

4. Naive Realism
- Evaluate whether the article presents its viewpoint as the only truth, dismisses alternatives, or discourages nuance.
- Score: 0 = balanced; 1 = somewhat one-sided; 2 = dogmatic or absolutist.
